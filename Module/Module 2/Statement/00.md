Linux & Shells
============================

## 1. Target

- Be familiar with Linux & various shells
- Be fluent with utilities `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, `xargs`, `find`, ...

## 2. Materials

- [UNIX / LINUX Tutorial](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/)
- [Shell Scripting: How to Automate Command Line Tasks Using Bash Scripting and Shell Programming](https://www.amazon.com/Shell-Scripting-Automate-Command-Programming/dp/151738043X)
- [vim](http://www.openvim.com/)
- [awk](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/awk/)
- [Shell Scripting Tutorial](https://www.shellscript.sh/index.html)
- `nohup` command
- [Command line text processing](https://github.com/learnbyexample/Command-line-text-processing)


## 3. Tools

- `terminator`
- `zsh`
- `oh-my-zsh`
- `vim`

## 4. Exercises

Writing zsh scripts to fulfill following exercises

### 4.1 Processing texts

- Count the number of lines satisfying a specific pattern in a log file
- Calculate KLOC of code C/C++ files in a directory

### 4.2 System

- Kill multiple processes following a patterns (using `awk`, `grep`, `xargs`)
- Kill processes opening a specific port (using `netstat`, `grep`...)
- List opennned ports, handles
- Find files via regular expressions, and remove them
- List, one at a time, all files larger than 100K in the /home/username directory tree. Give the user the option to delete or compress the file, then proceed to show the next one. Write to a logfile the names of all deleted files and the deletion times.

### 4.3 Others
- Write a script named `commit.sh` to push updates to a git repo

```sh
$ ./commit "This is a commit"

# so we don't have to issue following commands
# git add --all .
# git commit -m "This is a commit"
# git push -u origin master
```

- Parse `/etc/passwd`, and output its contents in nice, easy-to-read tabular form.

- Print (to stdout) all prime numbers between 60000 and 63000. The output should be nicely formatted in columns (hint: use printf).

- `[Hard]` Implement a script to accept integral input, sorting them via `sleep sort` algorithm

### 4.4 Docker (Advanced)

- Install docker

- Grab Ubuntu Image

- Start an instance of Ubuntu 

- SSH into the instance & install a simple static web. The web must be accessible from the host

- `Advanced`: Write a `Dockerfile` automating the whole process above. So to have the web started, we just need to invoke following commands:



```sh
$ docker build ...
$ docker run ...
```
