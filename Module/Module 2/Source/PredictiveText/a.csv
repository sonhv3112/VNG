How to Build an H-Bomb Making and owning an H-bomb is the kind of challenge real Americans seek. Who wants to be a passive victim of nuclear war when, with a little effort, you can be an active participant? Bomb shelters are for losers. Who wants to huddle together underground eating canned Spam? Winners want to push the button themselves. Making your own H-bomb is a big step in nuclear assertiveness training -- it's called Taking Charge. We're sure you'll enjoy the risks and the heady thrill of playing nuclear chicken. Introduction When the Feds clamped down on The Progressive magazine for attempting to publish an article on the manufacture of the hydrogen bomb, it piqued our curiosity. Was it really true that atomic and hydrogen bomb technology was so simple you could build an H-bomb in your own kitchen? Seven Days decided to find out. Food editor Barbara Ehrenreich, investigative reporter Peter Biskind, Photographer Jane Melnick and nuclear scientist Michio Kaku were given three days to cook up a workable H-bomb. They did and we have decided to share their culinary secrets with you. Not that Seven Days supports nuclear terrorism. We don't. We would prefer to die slowly from familiar poisons like low-level radiation, microwaves, DDT, DBCP, aflatoxins, PBBs, PBCs, or food dyes, rather than unexpectedly, say as hostage to a Latvian nationalist brandishing a homemade bomb. In our view the real terrorists are the governments, American, Soviet, French, Chinese, and British, that are hoarding H-bombs for their own use, and worse still, those governments (U.S., French and German) that are eagerly peddling advanced nuclear technology to countries like South Africa, Brazil, and Argentina so that they can make their own bombs. When these bombs are used, and they will be, it will be the world's big-time nuclear peddlers, along with corporate suppliers like General Electric, Westinghouse, and Gulf Oil, that we can thank for it. Gagging The Progressive will do no more for national security than backyard bomb shelters because like it or not the news is out. The heart of the successful H-bomb is the successful A-bomb. Once you've got your A-bombs made the rest is frosting on the cake. All you have to do is set them up so that when they detonate they'll start off a hydrogen-fusion reaction.  Part 1: Making Your Bomb Step 1: Getting the Ingredients Uranium is the basic ingredient of the A-bomb. When a uranium atom's nucleus splits apart, it releases a tremendous amount of energy (for its size), and it emits neutrons which go on to split other nearby uranium nuclei, releasing more energy, in what is called a 'chain reaction'. (When atoms split, matter is converted into energy according to Einstein's equation E=MC2. What better way to mark his birthday than with your own atomic fireworks?) There are two kinds (isotopes) of uranium: the rare U-235, used in bombs, and the more common, heavier, but useless U-238. Natural uranium contains less than 1 percent U-235 and in order to be usable in bombs it has to be 'enriched' to 90 percent U-235 and only 10 percent U-238. Plutonium-239 can also be used in bombs as a substitute for U-235. Ten pounds of U-235 (or slightly less plutonium) is all that is necessary for a bomb. Less than ten pounds won't give you a critical mass. So purifying or enriching naturally occurring uranium is likely to be your first big hurdle. It is infinitely easy to steal ready-to-use enriched uranium or plutonium than to enrich some yourself. And stealing uranium is not as hard as it sounds. There are at least three sources of enriched uranium or plutonium... Enriched uranium is manufactured at a gaseous diffusion plant in Portsmouth, Ohio. From there it is shipped in 10 liter bottles by airplane and trucks to conversion plants that turn it into uranium oxide or uranium metal. Each 10 liter bottle contains 7 kilograms of U-235, and there are 20 bottles to a typical shipment. Conversion facilities exist at Hematite, Missouri; Apollo, Pennsylvania; and Erwin, Tennessee. The Kerr-McGee plant at Crescent Oklahoma -- where Karen Silkwood worked -- was a conversion plant that 'lost' 40 lbs of plutonium. Enriched uranium can be stolen from these plants or from fuel-fabricating plants like those in New Haven, San Diego; or Lynchburg, Virginia. (A former Kerr-McGee supervisor, James V. Smith, when asked at the Silkwood trial if there were any security precautions at the plant to prevent theft, testified that 'There were none of any kind, no guards, no fences, no nothing.') Plutonium can be obtained from places like United Nuclear in Pawling, New York; Nuclear Fuel Services in Erwin, Tennessee; General Electric in Pleasanton, California; Westinghouse in Cheswick, Pennsylvania; Nuclear Materials and Equipment Corporation (NUMEC) in Leechburg, Pennsylvania; and plants in Hanfford, Washington and Morris, Illinois. According to Rolling Stone magazine the Israelis were involved in the theft of plutonium from NUMEC. Finally you can steal enriched uranium or plutonium while it's en-route from conversion plants to fuel fabricating plants. It is usually transported (by air or truck) in the form of uranium oxide, a brownish powder resembling instant coffee, or as a metal, coming in small chunks called 'broken buttons.' Both forms are shipped in small cans stacked in 5-inch cylinders braced with welded struts in the center of ordinary 55 gallon steel drums. The drums weigh about 100 pounds and are clearly marked 'Fissible Material' or 'Danger, Plutonium.' A typical shipment might go from the enrichment plant at Portsmouth, Ohio to the conversion plant in Hematite Missouri then to Kansas City by truck where it would be flown to Los Angeles and then trucked down to the General Atomic plant in San Diego. The plans for the General Atomic plant are on file at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's reading room at 1717 H Street NW Washington. A Xerox machine is provided for the convenience of the public. If you can't get hold of any enriched uranium you'll have to settle for commercial grade (20 percent U-235). This can be stolen from university reactors of a type called TRIGA Mark II, where security is even more casual than at commercial plants. If stealing uranium seems too tacky you can buy it. Unenriched uranium is available at any chemical supply house for $23 a pound. Commercial grade (3 to 20 percent enriched) is available for $40 a pound from Gulf Atomic. You'll have to enrich it further yourself. Quite frankly this can be something of a pain in the ass. You'll need to start with a little more than 50 pounds of commercial-grade uranium. (It's only 20 percent U-235 at best, and you need 10 pounds of U-235 so... ) But with a little kitchen-table chemistry you'll be able to convert the solid uranium oxide you've purchased into a liquid form. Once you've done that, you'll be able to separate the U-235 that you'll need from the U-238. First pour a few gallons of concentrated hydrofluoric acid into your uranium oxide, converting it to uranium tetrafluoride. (Safety note: Concentrated hydrofluoric acid is so corrosive that it will eat its way through glass, so store it only in plastic. Used 1-gallon plastic milk containers will do.) Now you have to convert your uranium tetrafluoride to uranium hexafluoride, the gaseous form of uranium, which is convenient for separating out the isotope U-235 from U-238. To get the hexafluoride form, bubble fluorine gas into your container of uranium tetrafluoride. Fluorine is available in pressurized tanks from chemical-supply firms. Be careful how you use it though because fluorine is several times more deadly than chlorine, the classic World War I poison gas. Chemists recommend that you carry out this step under a stove hood (the kind used to remove unpleasant cooking odors). If you've done your chemistry right you should now have a generous supply of uranium hexafluoride ready for enriching. In the old horse-and-buggy days of A-bomb manufacture the enrichment was carried out by passing the uranium hexafluoride through hundreds of miles of pipes, tubes, and membranes, until the U-235 was eventually separated from the U-238. This gaseous-diffusion process, as it was called is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. Gaseous-diffusion plants cover hundreds of acres and cost in the neighborhood of $2-billion each. So forget it. There are easier, and cheaper, ways to enrich your uranium. First transform the gas into a liquid by subjecting it to pressure. You can use a bicycle pump for this. Then make a simple home centrifuge. Fill a standard-size bucket one-quarter full of liquid uranium hexafluoride. Attach a six-foot rope to the bucket handle. Now swing the rope (and attached bucket) around your head as fast as possible. Keep this up for about 45 minutes. Slow down gradually, and very gently put the bucket on the floor. The U-235, which is lighter, will have risen to the top, where it can be skimmed off like cream. Repeat this step until you have the required 10 pounds of uranium. (Safety note: Don't put all your enriched uranium hexafluoride in one bucket. Use at least two or three buckets and keep them in separate corners of the room. This will prevent the premature build-up of a critical mass.) Now it's time to convert your enriched uranium back to metal form. This is easily enough accomplished by spooning several ladlefuls of calcium (available in tablet form from your drugstore) into each bucket of uranium. The calcium will react with the uranium hexafluoride to produce calcium fluoride, a colorless salt which can be easily be separated from your pure enriched uranium metal. A few precautions: • While uranium is not dangerously radioactive in the amounts you'll be handling, if you plan to make more than one bomb it might be wise to wear gloves and a lead apron, the kind you can buy in dental supply stores. • Plutonium is one of the most toxic substances known. If inhaled, a thousandth of a gram can cause massive fibrosis of the lungs, a painful way to go. Even a millionth of a gram in the lungs will cause cancer. If eaten plutonium is metabolized like calcium. It goes straight to the bones where it gives out alpha particles preventing bone marrow from manufacturing red blood cells. The best way to avoid inhaling plutonium is to hold your breath while handling it. If this is too difficult wear a mask. To avoid ingesting plutonium orally follow this simple rule: never make an A-bomb on an empty stomach. • If you find yourself dozing off while you're working, or if you begin to glow in the dark, it might be wise to take a blood count. Prick your finger with a sterile pin, place a drop of blood on a microscope slide, cover it with a cover slip, and examine under a microscope. (Best results are obtained in the early morning.) When you get leukemia, immature cells are released into the bloodstream, and usually the number of white cells increases (though this increase might take almost 2 weeks). Red blood cells look kind of like donuts (without the hole), and are slightly smaller than the white cells, each of which has a nucleus. Immature red cells look similar to white cells (i.e.. slightly larger and have a nucleus). If you have more than about 1 white cell (including immature ones) to 400 red cells then start to worry. But, depending upon your plans for the eventual use of the bomb, a short life expectancy might not be a problem.  Step 2: Assembling the A-Bomb Now that you've acquired the enriched uranium, all that's left is to assemble your A-bomb. Go find a couple of stainless steel salad bowls. You also want to separate your 10 pounds of U-235 into two hunks. (Keep them apart!) The idea is to push each half your uranium into the inside of a bowl. Take one hunk of your uranium and beat it into the inside of the first bowl. Uranium is malleable, like gold, so you should have no trouble hammering it into the bowl to get a good fit. Take another five-pound hunk of uranium and fit it into a second stainless steel bowl. These two bowls of U-235 are the 'subcritical masses' which, when brought together forcefully, will provide the critical mass that makes your A-bomb go. Keep them a respectful distance apart while working because you don't want them to 'go critical' on you... At least not yet. Now hollow out the body of an old vacuum cleaner and place your two hemispherical bowls inside, open ends facing each other, no less than seven inches apart, using masking tape to set them up in position. The reason for the steel bowls and the vacuum cleaner, in case you're wondering, is that these help reflect the neutrons back into the uranium for a more efficient explosion. 'A loose neutron is a useless neutron' as the A-bomb pioneers used to say. As far as the A-bomb goes, you're almost done. The final problem is to figure out how to get the two U-235 hemispheres to smash into each other with sufficient force to set off a truly effective fission reaction. Almost any type of explosive can be used to drive them together. Gunpowder, for example, is easily made at home from potassium nitrate, sulfur, and carbon. Or, you can get some blasting caps or TNT. (Buy them or steal them from a construction site.) Best of all is C4 plastic explosive. You can mold it around your bowls, and it's fairly safe to work with. (But, it might be wise to shape it around an extra salad bowl in another room, and THEN fit it to your uranium-packed bowls. This is particularly true in winter, when a stray static electrical charge might induce ignition in the C4. A responsible bomb maker considers it impolite to accidentally destroy more of the neighborhood than absolutely necessary.) Once the explosives are in place all you need to do is hook up a simple detonation device with a few batteries, a switch, and some wire. Remember though that it is essential that the two charges -- one on each side of the casing -- go off simultaneously. Now put the whole thing in the casing of an old Hoover vacuum cleaner and you're finished with this part of the process. The rest is easy.  Step 3: Make More A-Bombs Following the Directions Above  A Word to the Wise About Wastes After your A-bomb is completed you'll have a pile of moderately fatal radioactive wastes like U-238. These are not dangerous, but you do have to get rid of them. You can flush leftovers down the toilet. (Don't worry about polluting the ocean, there is already so much radioactive waste there, a few more bucketfuls won't make any waves whatsoever.) If you're the fastidious type -- the kind who never leaves gum under their seat at the movies -- you can seal the nasty stuff in coffee cans and bury it in the backyard, just like Uncle Sam does. If the neighbor kids have a habit of trampling the lawn, tell them to play over by the waste. You'll soon find that they're spending most of their time in bed.  Going First Class If you're like us, you're feeling the economic pinch, and you'll want to make your bomb as inexpensively as possible, consonant of course with reasonable yield. The recipe we've given is for a budget-pleasing H-bomb, no frills, no flourishes; it's just a simple 5-megaton bomb, capable of wiping out the New York metropolitan area, the San Francisco Bay area, or Boston. But don't forget, your H-bomb will only be as good as the A-bombs in it. If you want to spend a little more money you can punch-up your A-bomb considerably. Instead of centrifuging your uranium by hand, you can buy a commercial centrifuge. (Fisher Scientific sells one for about $1000.) You also might want to be fussier about your design. The Hiroshima bomb, a relatively crude one, only fissioned 1 percent of it's uranium and yielded only 13 kilotons. In order to fission more of the uranium, the force of your explosive 'trigger' needs to be evenly diffused around the sphere; the same pressure has to be exerted on every point of the sphere simultaneously. (It was a technique for producing this sort of simultaneous detonation by fashioning the explosives into lenses that the government accused Julius and Ethel Rosenberg of trying to steal).  Part 2: Putting Your H-Bomb Together The heart of the H-bomb is the fusion process. Several A-bombs are detonated in such a way as to create the extremely high temperature (100 million degrees C) necessary to fuse lithium deuteride (LiD) into helium. When the lithium nucleus slams into the deuterium nucleus, two helium nuclei are created, and if this happens to enough deuterium nuclei rapidly enough, the result is an enormous amount of energy: the energy of the H-bomb. You don't have to worry about stealing lithium deuteride, it can be purchased from any chemical-supply house. It costs $1000 a pound. If your budget won't allow it you can substitute lithium hydride at $40 a pound. You will need at least 100 pounds. It's a corrosive and toxic powder so be careful. Place the lithium deuteride or hydride in glass jars and surround it with four A-bombs in their casings. Attach them to the same detonator so that they will go off simultaneously. The container for the whole thing is no problem. They can be placed anywhere: Inside an old stereo console, a discarded refrigerator, etc... When the detonator sets off the four A-bombs all eight hemispheres of fissionable material will slam into each other at the same time creating four critical masses and four detonations. This will raise the temperature of the lithium deuteride to 100 million degrees C fast enough (a few billionths of a second) so that the lithium will not be blown all over the neighborhood before the nuclei have time to fuse. The result, at least 1000 times the punch of the puny A-bomb that leveled Hiroshima (20 million tons of TNT vs. 20 thousand tons.)  Part 3: What to do With Your Bomb Now that you have a fully assembled H-bomb housed in an attractive console of your choice you may be wondering, 'What should I do with it?' Every family will have to answer this question according to its own tastes and preferences, but you may want to explore some possibilities which have been successfully pioneered by the American government. 1. Sell Your Bomb and Make a Pile of Money In these days of rising inflation, increasing unemployment, and an uncertain economic outlook, few businesses make as much sense as weapons production. If your career forecast is cloudy, bomb sales may be the only sure way to avoid the humiliation of receiving welfare, or unemployment. Regardless of your present income level, a home H-bomb business can be an invaluable income supplement, and certainly a profitable alternative to selling Tupperware or pirated Girl Scout cookies. Unfortunately for the family bomb business, big government has already cornered a large part of the world market. But this does not mean that there is a shortage of potential customers. The raid on Entebee was the Waterloo of hijacking, and many nationalist groups are now on the alert for new means to get their message across. They'd jump at the chance to get hold of an H-bomb. Emerging nations which can't ante up enough rice or sugar to buy themselves a reactor from G.E. or Westinghouse are also shopping around. You may wonder about the ethics of selling to nations, or groups, whose goals you may disapprove of. But here again, take a tip from our government: forget ideology -- it's cash that counts. And remember, H-bomb sales have a way of escalating, almost like a chain reaction. Suppose you make a sale to South Yemen which you believe to be a Soviet puppet. Well within a few days some discrete inquiries from North Yemen and possibly the Saudis, the Egyptians and the Ethiopians as well can be expected. Similarly, a sale to the IRA will generate a sale to the Ulster government; and a sale to the Tanzanians will bring the Ugandans running, and so forth. It doesn't matter WHICH side you're on, only how many sides there are. Don't forget about the possibility of repeat sales to the same customer. As the experience of both the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. has shown, each individual nation has a potentially infinite need for H-bombs. No customer -- no matter how small -- can ever have too many. 2. Use Your Bomb at Home Many families are attracted to the H-bomb simply as a 'deterrent.' A discrete sticker on the door or on the living room window saying 'This Home Protected by H-bomb' will discourage IRS investigators, census takers, and Jehovah's Witnesses. You'll be surprised how fast the crime rate will go down and property values will go up. And once the news gets out that you are a home H-bomb owner you'll find that you have unexpected leverage in neighborhood disputes over everything from parking places and stereo noise levels to school tax rates. So relax and enjoy the pride and excitement of home H-bomb ownership!  Is It For You? Let's be honest. The H-bomb isn't for everyone. Frankly there are people who can't handle it. They break out in hives at the very mention of mega-death, fallout, or radiation sickness. The following quiz will help you find out whether you have what it takes for home H-bomb ownership. If you can answer 'yes' to six or more of these questions, then you're emotionally eligible to join the nuclear club. If not, a more conventional weapon may be more your cup of tea, try botulism-toxin, laser rays, or nerve gas. 1. I ignore the demands of others. 2. I subscribe to one or more of the following: Soldier of Fortune, Hustler, Popular Mechanics, Self. 3. Though I have many interesting acquaintances, I am my own best friend. 4. I know what to say after you say 'Hello,' but I am seldom interested in pursuing the conversation. 5. I have seen the movie 'The Deer Hunter' more than once. 6. I know that everyone can be a winner if they want to, and I resent whiners. 7. I own one or more of the following: handgun, video game, trash compactor, snowmobile. 8. I am convinced that leukemia is psychosomatic. 9. I am aware that most vegetarians are sexually impotent. 10. I have read evidence that solar energy is a Communist conspiracy.  Myths About Nuclear War Ever since the first mushroom cloud over Hiroshima ushered in the atomic age, a small group of nay-sayers and doom-mongers has lobbied, campaigned and demonstrated to convince Americans that H-bomb ownership, along with nuclear power, is dangerous and unhealthy. Using their virtual stranglehold over the media, these people have tried to discredit everything nuclear from energy to war. They have vastly overrated the risks of nuclear bombs and left many Americans feeling demoralized and indecisive; not sure where the truth lies. Well, here are the myths, and here are the facts. Myth: After a nuclear exchange the earth will no longer be suitable for human habitation. Fact: This is completely false. According to one scientist (quoted in John McPee's The Curve of Binding Energy) 'The largest bomb that has ever been exploded anywhere was 60 megatons, and that is one-thousandth the force of an earthquake, one-thousandth the force of a hurricane. We have lived with earthquakes and hurricanes for a long time.' Another scientist adds, 'It is often assumed that a full blown nuclear war would be the end of life on earth. That is far from the truth. To end life on earth would take at least a thousand times the total yield of all the nuclear explosives existing in the world, and probably a lot more.' Even if humans succumbed, many forms of life would survive a nuclear free-for-all, cockroaches, certain forms of bacteria, and lichens, for instance. Myth: Radiation is bad for you. Fact: Everything is bad for you if you have too much of it. If you eat too many bananas you'll get a stomach-ache. If you get too much sun you can get sunburned (or even skin cancer). Same thing with radiation. Too much may make you feel under the weather, but nuclear industry officials insist that there is no evidence that low-level radiation has any really serious adverse effects. And, high-level radiation may bring unexpected benefits. It speeds up evolution by weeding out unwanted genetic types and creating new ones. (Remember the old saying, 'Two heads are better than one.') Nearer to home, it's plain that radiation will get rid of pesky crab grass and weeds, and teenagers will find that brief exposure to a nuclear burst vaporizes acne and other skin blemishes. (Many survivors of the Hiroshima bomb found that they were free from skin and it's attendant problems forever.) We hope this clears up any misconceptions you may have had. Enjoy your H-Bomb!           "

So, without further ado here is the link to 24-hour K-Pop  urlLink audio  and the  urlLink video  streaming.  Enjoy.         "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"10,June,2004","             I had an interesting conversation with my Dad this morning.  We were talking about where Koreans put their money.  Invariably, they have a lot of real estate and cash.  (Cash would include short term investments under one year as well as savings accounts.)  The reason?  Real estate makes money here.  A lot of money.  I've seen surveys of Seoul real estate rising about 10-15% PER YEAR for long stretches, even after taking into account the 1997 Crisis (referred to as the IMF crisis here, although it was the IMF that bailed Korea out).  Compare that to Korean corporate bonds which fell 90-99% in 1997 and only modestly recovered, and a local stock market (represented by KOSPI, or their version of the Dow Jones Index) that has not gone appreciably above its 1980s high of 1,000 points (it is now about 800 points, see  urlLink link ) and you can see why real estate makes sense here.  But back to the conversation...I noted that here a 'real big' or 'elite' real estate investor has over 6 billion won (about USD 5,000,000, see  urlLink converter ) in properties.  Dad seemed a little flabbergasted.  'What the heck do they need 5 million dollars for?  They don't need that much to retire.'  Maybe so, but there is a lot of risk here too.  Take real estate (or any other South Korean asset) for example: if the North toots their horn louder or make a move on the country that 5,000,000 USD is worth about 5 cents.  Also, all of it is denominated in won which, during the 'IMF Crisis', dropped about 50% vis-a-vis the USD. Also, if you make a bad investment or some fall victim to a scam--the latest here was the  urlLink Good Morning City  project--you're toast.  I saw a lady on TV who lost everything in it.  Her comment (between the tears): 'Now I know what it's like to go from a rich person to a beggar in one day.'  If you have one of those, some saber-rattling from North Korea and a weak exchange rate your little nest egg could be almost wiped out.  The government has almost zero help for unemployed, disabled or otherwise disenfranchised workers.  The role of family is more important here...so if you have money you should help your family, and if you don't then you should go to them first.  Thus the idea that more is more.  Koreans go all out in most things they do, and investing is no different.  Why have one apartment when you can have 7?  The  urlLink jeonse  system supports this as well.  You see, if you have a 400,000 USD apartment and you rent it out there are two systems you can use in Korea (neither of which are the Western ones, except in rare circumstances).  1.  Renter signs a 2-year contract and deposits about half the market value (200,000 USD) with the owner.  No monthly rent is paid, but the owner can invest in Korean Treasury Bills for about 4-5% per year.  That's a monthly rent/return of $750.  At the end of the term the 200,000 USD is returned to the renter.  2.  Renter signs a 1-year or 2-year contract and deposits about 10%-20% of the market value of the property (10,000-20,000 USD) plus some monthly rent of $400-$600 a month.  In both cases, if the value of the property increases or decreases the jeonse will need to be topped-up or partially refunded.  (Of course I'm using USD in this to save my '0' key and to help 'foreigners' reference it better.)  Thus, if you buy a place for $400,000 you can turn around and rent it out and get $200,000 to (if you like) buy another place or whatever.  Since there are very, very few mortgages in Korea (kind of a cash society, although there are home-equity lines of credit) the system here is a bit different.  The key, of course, is that real estate prices keep going up.         "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"10,June,2004","             Somehow Coca-Cola has a way of summing up things so well.  In the early 1970s they had as their flagship jingle 'I'd Like to Buy the World a Coke' (to the tune of 'I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing') that pretty much summed up the post-Woodstock era so well.  It didn't add much to sales, but it was a catchy tune.  In Korea Coke's theme is  urlLink Stop Thinking. Feel it.  which pretty much sums up a lot about Korea and Koreans.  (Look at how relaxed that couple is, now that they stopped thinking and started feeling.) Of course they have a high regard for education and math and logic and such, but deep down I think many Koreans really like to work on emotion more than anything else.  Westerners seem to sublimate this moreso, or at least display it in a different way.  Maybe scratch all that...Westerners and Koreans are probably pretty similar, but the context in which we do it is different.  Anyways, if you think you're losing it in Korea just repeat to yourself 'Stop thinking, feel it. Stop thinking, feel it. Stop thinking, feel it.' and everything will be alright.         "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"10,June,2004","             If anything, Korea is a country of extremes.  Everything here seems fad-based.  I think it may come from Korea's history.  It has been invaded a reported 700 times over the years, and each time they got independence I imagine they had to move quickly to get to the next level before the next war or occupation.  Lately (well, not really lately...in 1945) the Japanese Occupation ended.  Then the Korean War occurred from 1950-3.  After that there was turmoil, but in 1961 Park Chung Hee took over as dictator/president.  He had elections, in which everyone was 'encouraged' to vote, but he was still a dictator.  After his assassination in 1979 the next few leaders were basically of the same ilk.  President Park did some amazing things in his time, however.  He took an incredibly backward country and set it on the road to industrialization. Japan had stripped Korea of its resources, people and even its language and culture (many buildings and palaces were razed and Japanese was the official language here from 1910-1945) but President Park was determined to change that.  He orchestrated the 'Han River Miracle' (the Han River, or Hangang 한강 is the main river in Seoul/Korea) and Korea made terrific strides, if at the expense of some civil liberties.  Fastforward to the present, and my point, and we see that Korea is the world's #1 wired nation.  More than Canada, Finland and way beyond the U.S.A.  There was a craze to have PC방s (PC bangs or rooms) EVERYWHERE in the country.  As well, instead of PlayStation-like games where players go against the computer or one or two people, Korean gamers (always the communal types) play online games with hundreds or thousands of others. in typical Korean fashion, gamers who left their seat for a second could not pause their game...in fact, they may be eliminated.  So PCbang owners sold drinks, ramen nooodles and other junk to their clientele.  It was just a matter of time before someone died, as related in  urlLink this article .  Yes, someone died from being on the PC.  People thought he was just sleeping (imagine how long he was there before they really checked him out) but, alas, he was the first known casulty of the Net in Korea, maybe the world.  Korea, built on extremes, both good and bad.         "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"10,June,2004","             Take a read of this news article from urlLink JoongAng Ilbo  about North Korea's opinion on the scaling down of troops in Seoul and Korea (specifically, 3,600 troops are heading to Iraq and by the end of 2005 the current total of 37,000 should drop to about 24,500).   North blasts U.S. troop cuts  North Korea again blasted the United States yesterday for what it calls 'an increase of U.S. defense capabilities' after the planned relocation of 3,600 U.S. troops in South Korea to Iraq. Pyeongyang's state-run television network said the plans were preparations for a second Korean war.  'Even though part of the U.S. ground forces will be transferred to Iraq, instead of causing a capability vacuum, U.S. President Bush is augmenting his war policy against the North,' the broadcast complained.  'The U.S. security commitment [to South Korea] is a commitment for preemptive war against us,' the current affairs commentary said.     Ok, let me get this straight...moving troops OUT of South Korea and, further, OUT of the area closest to North Korea (the DMZ, or DeMilitarized Zone) is somehow INCREASING the U.S. defense capabilities in South Korea???  Well, I've read a lot of North Korean propaganda (such as at  urlLink DPRK.com , check out the DPRK News section) but this one is pretty unreal.  And with that I'd like to remind everyone that those in the DPRK (I should tell you that means Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or North Korea) are probably very good people, it's just the leadership that seems to be making all the waves (I could be wrong, but I'm not going to go up there and find out).  The Korean War from 1950-3 was a brutal event that severed many families...some of whom are now lucky enough to see their aged relatives again (remember, it's been 50+ years) in special reunion projects (albeit only for a few hours before everyone is whisked off to their respective countries).  Many, however have or will pass on without ever seeing a sister, brother, child, parent or boy/girlfriend again.  We in the West, especially Canada where we've never had a war on our own soil except the War of 1812, could never fully comprehend such things.  It really makes your wonder how far one would go to support ideology...I guess we have an idea now.         "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"09,June,2004","             I surf the English news sites a lot looking for tidbits on Korea and how foreigners (like me) view the 'Hermit Kingdom' but also as a way to keep up with this fast-moving place.  Sometimes, though, one needs to check the veracity of the figures put in the papers...especially the local ones.  Here are two examples of how the English version of the Korea Times and that of the JoongAng Ilbo (Daily).  The first is pretty straightforward.   urlLink Korea Times  said that 249 people were arrested for forging Korean passports, but  urlLink JoongAng Ilbo  says just 114 were accused.  Huh?  Another one:  urlLink JoongAng Ilbo  said that S&P is positive on Korean banks (a good thing), while the  urlLink Korea Times  said that S&P was a tad worried about the bad loans that banks extended to small and medium-sized firms.  I have no idea why the simple facts seem to be presented so differently...it can't simply be translation, can it?         "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"09,June,2004","             Ah, the Korean language...it looks so difficult at first, then as you figure out how to read Hanguel (Korea's surprisingly easy-to-learn alphabet of 24 characters) it seems so easy. Then the vocabulary starts. Oh no. Then the backwards (to us) sentence structure.  Yikes!  Luckily there are many options for us slow-witted foreigners to take on the language.  Of course I could list them here but  urlLink this JoongAng article  says a lot and there are more resources  urlLink here .    Well, if you're a guy here is some motivation for you: Jeon Ji Hyun (전지현), the latest 20-something (24, actually) star of movies and CFs (I hear this means Commercial Feature, but not positive).  I saw her latest movie on Sunday night.  It's hard to describe the name...the English version is 'Windstruck' but the Korean version is 여친소 (yeochinso) which is short for 내여자친구를소개합니다 (ne yeojachingu rul sogayhamnida) or 'I'd like to introduce you to my girlfriend'.  Surprisingly, both titles make sense.  If you like, there is a website (Korean and English, looks quite good, actually)  urlLink here .  The movie is shown in theatres with subtitles at special times, that info is  urlLink here . For a list of many of the theatres in Seoul click....  urlLink here!    urlLink    Here is a great reason to learn Korean...if I wasn't already married, that is.  I went with a few foreigners as well as a local/Korean/National...of course the Korean HAD to take a picture...so I HAVE to put it up here.   urlLink    Here we are after the movie...and before the hof/bar.     Update:  A bud of mine passed  urlLink this link  on to me. It's 전지현 in a Giordano ad. Apparently it was NOT aired in Korea (nothing XXX about it, it's all about sensibilities of some sort).

3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"09,June,2004","             If you click on my profile you'll make a not-so-startling discovery...I was born in Year of the Pig, as they say in the Korean/Chinese calendar.  But blogger.com figured it would be more appropriate to call it Year of the Boar/bore...thanks guys.  Anyways, you may be wondering how a fat, lazy, smelly Canadian guy born in a little town waaaaaay up north finds himself in a place like Seoul...and Yeouido, no less, where only a handful of foreigners visit, let alone live and work.  The culprit is my wife.  She is Korean, as you may know, and when I was doing financial consulting in Canada we came across an interesting client.  He found us through his wife's (see a pattern here?  Korean women rule the men) reading my column in the Vancouver Chosun (Chosun is the name of the last dynasty to rule Korea--it was ended by the 1910-1945 Japanese occupation) which you'll find  urlLink here . It's all in Korean, my email and webpage have changed, though.  Anyways, this client is a big guy here in Seoul as well as in Canada and wanted (for some reason) to do something for us...so the next time he went to Seoul we went as well (with our first son, second one wasn't around yet).  When we arrived in Seoul for our 2-3 week visit we met his 'godfathers' as he called them.  He wasn't mixed up in anything, he just liked the sound of being untouchable.  From there we met another guy then another guy and then, the next day, my current CEO.  We had what economists call a 'coincidence of wants'.  He wanted a foreigner with training and experience in securities and alternative assets and I wanted a guy with the connections to get things done in Seoul.  After a week or so of meeting for dinner and such (his English was pretty good and is better now, but my wife did a lot of translation in the first part) he said: 'Don't go back to Canada, stay here and work with me.'  Not work for me...with me.  That was interesting.  I knew he had a more enlightened view than most Korean bosses right then and there.  So here I am.  It's not perfect, I can't speak a lot of the language and sometimes I almost go nuts here what with the differences in culture and business, but it's not bad at all.  I also go home every 2 months or so (my wife had baby #2 in Canada and is still there for a bit longer) which means lots of time in airplanes.  I always fly  urlLink Singapore Air  but even then, the prospect of being in the air for 100 hours a year is not all that appealing (ya, that's over 4 DAYS flying, over 1% of the year).  I do, however, watch about 20-25 movies a year on the plane, which is cool because Singapore Air has individual monitors with on-demand TV and movies for ALL passengers.         "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"09,June,2004","             Last night was pretty fun...mostly because of the company I kept.  I recently met a couple of finance-types here in Yeouido (which isn't too hard to do, as it's referred to as Korea's Wall Street) who spoke pretty good English (which is a rarity here not only in Yeouido but everywhere in Korea).  They had studied outside Korea and deal with international business...but still my brutal Canadian accent made it pretty tough for them to figure out what I was saying sometimes.  There was one time that their accent got in the way, though.  When we went to the restaurant the guy (Junseok, the gal is named Hye-Kyung) asked: 'Do you like deok?'  I wrote it just as I heard it.  I thought he meant dog (they eat that here) so I called his bluff and said, 'Sure, let's go! What kind of dog?' 'Oh no, deok, deok!' 'Ya, dog?' 'No, deok,' he said again. Then I figured out that he meant 'duck' and said, 'Oh, &#50724;&#47532; (oh-ri), duck! Not &#44060; (gay), dog! Why didn't you just speak Korean?  I know &#50724;&#47532; and &#44060;!'  The food was great, then we went to the obligatory 이차 (ee-cha, thanks Hye-Kyung for the correction) or second round.  Koreans can never just go to one place to eat and drink.  Usually we will wander the streets and go out to three, four or five places. A couple of weeks ago in Hongdae (university bar district here) we went to 4 places: the &#49328;&#45209;&#51648; (san-nak-ji, living octopus) restaurant, Old Rock (cool bar), a &#45432;&#47000;&#48169; (noraebang, Korean word for karaoke) and finally clubnb (or noise basement) until the wee hours of the morning.  (Personally I prefer the Kangnam version of clubnb, but since we were in Hongdae we went to that one.)  The coolest thing here about bar-hopping/pub-crawling is there is almost never a lineup and very rarely a cover (just in the clubs, never in bars).  I think this is because people are always moving.  In Canada if you get in a bar you never, never leave until you go home...which means those who want to get in have to lineup.  Also, if a Korean is asked to wait (for anything, especially after a few drinks) they will just balk and leave...and no bar-owner would like that.  Maybe that's why Koreans in general are moving around more and Canadians are so sedate (relatively...if you've lived in both places you know what I mean).   Update:  looks like everyone wants to be on my blog...for some reason.  Here are the pics of my gracious hosts of the evening.   urlLink    Junseok, who works in International Business and has an MBA...he's trying to come up with a fitting Western name for himself, if you have one to suggest just leave a comment, please.   urlLink    Hae-Kyung, who works with him.  She too has an MBA (and from my wife's alma mater of Ewha Women's University, no less).  Hae-Kyung is really good at English and is quite bright...and single (men, take note). She thinks her face looks like the moon, or 달덩이 (Daldeong-ee) as they say here, I guess so...         "

Our lovely officegirl Jung Mi (please no letters, that's what secretaries are called here) went to LG Twins building and got me a new phone.  I really needed one on account of (i) my old one was all in Korean...which was fine because I memorized where to go to do things on it...and (ii) the screen kept going blank because I produce copious amounts of sweat when I inline skate and was dumb enough to be on the phone at the same time.  Well, after 4 screens at 60,000 won a pop I decided it's time to get a new one...but I may end up breaking this one too.  It's soooooo cooooool.  It has a little camera which I used to take a picture of the box (of course it took me a while to figure out that I couldn't use it to take a pic of the actual phone).  I also took a pic of our lovely officegirl...and then inputted her name and number as well...then ordered up caller ID (something I didn't have before, much to my chagrin).  Then I asked her to call me to test it out.  Her mug showed up on the little screen on the outside of the phone (how cool is that?!?!) and she immediately started panicking and saying, 'Change! Change!'  haha, Some Korean girls really hate to have pictures taken of them.  She did, however, insist that I put the pic on this posting...go figure.  This phone really rocks.  I can take pictures, email them or send to other phones, and send and receive normal emails too. Also, it has a language converter so everything is finally in English.  It's tiny, too...like the size of a fat businesscard.   urlLink    Here she is doing the Korean sign for 'take my picture'.   urlLink    Here is a coworker of mine with the same pose.  Why? Why?         "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"09,June,2004","             One thing I love about Seoul (and I mean this about Korea in general...I just happen to be a little Seoul-centric) is the street sellers.  I don't really trust the food they sell on the side of the road (except ice cream) but virtually everything else is fair game for me.  For example, to get ready for my trip to Canada and generally stock up, in the last two weeks I bought:  2 plants in a can for my nieces (8,000 won) 2 lightweight sports shirts for inlining (10,000 won for both) 1 pair of shorts for inlining (20,000 won) 3 bags of dried 고구마 (goguma, sweet potatoes or yams, they were selling 1 for 3,000 won , 2 for 5,000 but I got 3 for 6,000) 1 tie (at an amazing price of 5,000 won, or USD 4...and I can't really tell how it's worse than the ones I bought for USD 100 back home.) 10 disposible razors (for 1,000 won, or USD 0.80 FOR ALL TEN) 1 noise-making toy hammer for boy #2 (1,000 won) 3 Disney photo albums (but I'm sure ol' Walt didn't make a penny on these....just 1,000 won each)  The clothes-seller guy spoke pretty good English...I know because he held my hostage for 5 minutes as we talked about how Korean men are getting fatter (hence his stock of larger sizes for husky guys like me) and how he learned English working for the US Army about 20-30 years ago.  The goguma-guy didn't know a lot of English, but he did speak Spanish owing to the fact that he lived in Argentina for a few years.  Unfortunately, Spanish is not one of my languages...I know a fair bit of French from my school-days, a smattering Japanese and, of course, some Korean. Anyways, when I passed the goguma-guy later in the week I gave him a big 'hola!' (Spanish for hello, and the extent of my proficiency) and he returned one as well...wow, bridging the cultures with another one...how UN of me.  Below is a picture of the famous Yeouido tie-truck.  This guy stops in the hotspots and unloads silk and polyester ties on neckwear-hungry salarymen.   urlLink    Here they are: 2 for 5,000 won (USD 4.50)!         "

The only thing that seems 'safe' is pork.  Of course, as you may know, oh-gyup-sal literally means 5 layers of fat...so maybe it's not super healthy.  Well, I wasn't that bad, I did do 2 hours of inline skating (as they call it here...rollerblading seems to have a tough time rolling off the Korean tongue) beforehand...but the 오겹살 was drowned by a lovely concoction called 오십세주 (oh-ship-say-joo) which is a 50/50 mix of 백세주 (baek-say-ju, literally: hundred year alcohol) and 소주 (soju, literally: booze) thus the translation of the combined drink is called 50 year alcohol.

3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"18,June,2004","             Here is the latest from the Korean rumor mill (it made it all the way to Coquitlam, and my wife's ears).  It seems The Grand Hyatt Hotel's (in Itaewon)  urlLink J.J. Mahoney's  has a reputation for beautiful Korean ladies using it as a place to pick up foreign (likely white) men...even married ones.  So, if you're single and looking for a good time check out J.J.'s (just bring a lot of dough, the prices are about two times that of most other Western bars).  If you're married...well, that's up to you (you should know that some of the gals on the prowl there are 'ladies for sale' there was well, and the prices are reportedly quite high).  If your man is in Seoul and reading this (or otherwise knows the score) better get a polygraph...from what I saw some of those gals are pretty good looking (not that I was looking, of course).  Well, that's it for tonight.  I gotta take the boy to school tomorrow at like 9AM (which is early for my vacation-time now).         "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"17,June,2004","             Well, I stand corrected, again.  Yesterday I blogged that Coquitlam was an oasis of Whiteness in the sea of Asians that is Vancouver, but oh how I was wrong.  We went to the, aptly named, Coquitlam Mall today and put Spencer in the play area with a few other kids.  I heard a lady speaking Korean to her boy, then a flock (well, three) ajumas (older Korean ladies) came and sat near us.  Later, when we went to the pool, we saw that the neighbors right next to us and across the street are Koreans too.  Then on the way back I learned that another two sets of neighbors are Korean as well.  They're everywhere!  It's actually pretty cool.  One thing about Koreans is they have a pretty good sense of community.  Get a group of white people (who aren't farmers) together and we seem to be pretty stand-offish...or at least it takes a while to warm up.  Koreans, as you may know,  urlLink refer to each other as sister or brother  as soon as 3 minutes of meeting one another (as I have seen).  This is, I think, quite extraordinary.  From first meetings with my son my wife called the girls in the area 'nuna' or 'older sister, as said by a  younger brother' (they have a special word for every family member).  Also, since Koreans don't normally take to English all that well (or quickly) they really, really appreciate speaking with someone from home.  Thus, the community here is quite tight.  So I've still got jetlag...although it's pretty nice not to have to work through it.  The boys tend to keep me moving all day, though.  Usually I sleep at 3AM or 4AM then get up at 11AM, but it's not a good  urlLink REM  sleep.  My best sleep seems to be 1-2 hour naps at 3PM or 7PM.  When I wake up from those it's really like getting up in the morning; and getting up in the morning is like waking up at midnight.  My father-in-law thinks I should just adjust 100% in like 2 days, but I'm not sure if I'm built that way.  If I need to I can do it, but it's like I'm on vacation here.  Besides, I do my work at night anyways, when the kids are asleep (and Seoul is awake).  I guess that's it for now.  Nothing more profound than this from the day, which is a little sad.  I love it here: so clean, peaceful and easy to live; but I kinda miss Seoul too: so dirty, loud and easy to get run down by  urlLink deliveryboys on motorcycles .         "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"16,June,2004","             So I've been in Vancouver a few days now...in Coquitlam, actually.  It's really an interesting place; I used to think it was full of Chinese people (not that there's anything wrong with that, but Vancouver's #1 mother tongue is Mandarin/Cantonese, so you'd assume there'd be tons here).  Our area is up on a hill in a little bit of paradise, actually.  It has started to remind me of Newport in that show  urlLink The O.C.  (O.C. means Orange County).  Well, it isn't full of million dollar homes (but there are a few) but the topography is similar (hills, lots of parks, but no beach) and it's really, really white here.  I think the only Koreans I've seen have been family and Ensign Harry Kim on Star Trek: Voyager (ya, still have jetlag...watching anything that hits the screen here).  On that note, I think I'm having T.V. overload.  Well, with the kids I don't get to see too much of it, but when I do I'm boggled by the 60+ stations (and that's not even satellite!) and all, save one, of them are in ENGLISH!  Wow!  In Seoul I didn't even bother with cable so all I had was  urlLink AFN  (American Forces Network) (that guy on the homepage is their 6:30 newsanchor...the very reason I like to inline/rollerblade from 6-8PM).  Even if you have cable you only get like 2-3 other 'B' movie stations...nothing to write home about.  Truth be told, though, AFN has a pretty good lineup and I get to learn all about opsec (operational security) and that the U.S. Army in Korea is looking for E-4s and E-5s (enlisted ranks) to be MPs (Military Police).  So if you can handle the G.I. ads AFN is pretty cool.  Anyways, I didn't remember so many ads for weight-loss programs, get-rich-quick schemes and fantastic kitchen products, but there they were.  Of course in Korea most people are pretty fit and they know the best way to get rich is to marry rich or work hard--there are some ads there for kitchen and cleaning product, though, proving that some things truly are universal.  One ad that did throw me, though, was one for a 'male enhancement' pill.  What?!?!?  You take a pill for a bigger willi?  One version even had about 30 allusions to 'wood' throughout it.  I thought it was a spoof...maybe it was...it was on CNBC during  urlLink The Dennis Miller Show .   If anyone knows, please comment.  Ok, back to my time here.  We went down to the clubhouse to have a dip (ya, it's a little swanky...but the pool is outside, so it's not super-swanky) and there were some 18-something gals there sunning themselves and gabbing.  Man, this is NOT Seoul.  For one thing, no one actually tries to get a tan in Korea.  They wear Darth Vader-inspired visors to keep out all the rays they can and everyone is totally covered up.  Even when exercising Korean have pants, long-sleeves,  even suits .  Also, two of the three of them were 'plus size'.  They weighed like 2-3 TIMES that of a typical Korean gal.  (Not that that's a bad thing...it's just differences...please, no flames.)  Then you have to think...if they are 18 aren't they still in school?  By that I mean, they have not graduated from college.  An 18-year old Korean would be in the library or at a DVD bang, at least.  Most likely not at a pool (and I hear they're there everyday for hours on end)...what a different lifestyle.  Even after school is finished they'd be working or looking for a husband, or both.  Let's face it, many Koreans have little time to be idle (I must say, they do take time to drink and go to the sauna, though).  Maybe I'm becoming too Korean now, beating up these gals simply for having a little fun.  All I know is if they did that in Korea people might think they are  urlLink R.S.  (room salon, or places where men pay women to drink with them, sing with them and...uh...do other things) girls.  Maybe that's part of the Korean ideal.  Women should study and work and find a husband and if they are 'wasting' their time everyday then they must be of low moral fiber.  Hmmmm...there could be something to that.  Maybe it's part of the reason why so many Korean gals work their butts off (literally, Korean women are usually devoid of a derriere) and seem to push off their own pleasure in some Calvinist tradition.  Korean men seem to support this as it not only support the Confucius ideals that many Koreans follow but makes their place as symbolic leader of the home that much more solid (whether it is deserved or not, and we know that in many Korean homes a strong wife controls more than she advertises).         "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"15,June,2004","             Whenever I see a pregnant Korean lady I really feel for her, because I know that within a few months she will have a 3-5 year sentence to complete and utter child-rearing duties.  As with most things Korean, mothers go all out...right from before conception to...well, it never stops.    Today I got a taste of that.  What a day!  My 3-year old (Spencer) woke me up at 9AM (which is early seeing as I still have some jetlag and was up from midnight to 3AM last night).  The younger, Winston, was already up, too.  My wife and I must have fed these kids like 5-7 times during the day, they just never stop!  Spencer and I went to his swimming class.  We get a discount on regular swimming since he's enrolled.  The gal behind the counter asked if he was swimming outside of the class as well...I really had no idea what was happening and said, 'I'm not sure.'  She said, in no uncertain terms, that it meant a lot to her whether he was or not.  I just said, ok, he is, how much?  Let's see $1.30 plus $2.60...$3.90.  You've got to be kidding?! You're bent about chun-on? (1,000 won/$1.15)?  This would not happen in Seoul.  They'd see Spencer and pay HIM to come into there!  Anyways, what I did with him in the pool was pretty much what the 'instructor' did as well...but she had 3 kids to handle.  I thought he'd be doing lengths or strokes, but I guess not yet.  After swimming I got my wife a Starbucks coffee.  She loves the stuff, and apparently can't justify to herself to buy herself one...those selfless Korean women, bless their hearts.  After I came home there was shopping to do.  I volunteered to go (kudos for me and time to think), then I suggested Spencer come too (thought he'd fall asleep in the car, especially after swimming) then thought we might as well all go (the list she gave me was going to take a couple of people to complete).  Well, the kids stayed up the whole time and I started to realize that this parenting thing is a lot harder when the kids are actually in the country with you (I'm usually in Seoul) and it's just you two (her mother and sister were out of town).  Good God, these kids didn't sleep until 11PM!  Someday they'll make great investment bankers, I mused.  To all those out there who are single parents, or even just parents, get yourself a Starbucks...you may not be able to drink it before it gets cold, but at least you have a piece of luxury in your hand for a few seconds.         "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"14,June,2004","             My wife posed a strange question to me tonight.  Apparently this is the new fad in Korea...men are asked 'if your wife and your mother are drowning (neither can swim) and you have time to save just one of them who would you choose?'.  Many men say, 'my mother, because I can always remarry...but I can never replace my mom.'  Ok, true enough, but usually its the wives who ask this and one fellow I know said, in front of a throng of relatives (including his wife) that he'd save his mom.  The wife was not impressed.  Let's look at this on a more cultural level for a moment.  Much of Korean tradition is based on Confucius' teachings; where younger take care of elder, women take care of men and duty to family is first.  Parents sacrifice a lot for their kids to get them the best education, lifestyle and necessities; children, in turn, are expected to do the same when they have the means.  Thus, a man should choose to save his mother, who did everything for him (and perhaps still does) rather than his wife who is a bit of a late-comer.  The reason for all of this ultimatum questioning comes from family conflict.  A husband's mother often endures a lot from her husband, children, society and her own mother-in-law and, not one to stop the cycle, she will often unleash her frustration on the unsuspecting wife.  She comes to pry into, advise upon and attempt to control many parts of the couple's lives under the guise of helping her dear son.  With divorce becoming more accepted and this has broken up more than a few marriages lately; and now people are getting a little pre-emptive, perhaps, in asking the husband to make a choice in order to ascertain his convictions.  So, men, if you get this question posed to you first think of who is asking it (probably your wife) take a look around the room to find out who is listening and then give the best answer you can.  Just remember, you likely sleep with your wife every night, not your mother.         "

They have those personal monitors for everyone with on-demand movies, TV shows and games..and some lovely-looking stewardesses, of course.  Another thing going for them is their empathy with their passengers.  I've twice been bumped up to business class (with it's better meals and basically flat sleeper beds...what an experience that is).  Once because the travel agent made a mistake and SAI decided they'd make my life a bit easier (hint: if you take the same flight 5-10 times they get to know you, too) and another time my flight was overbooked so I too business to San Francisco and got another one to Vancouver (both covered by SAI) as well as 500 Sing$ (300 USD, 350,000 won) which made for a 40% discount from my ticket price.  Anyways, this time I was in line for about 30 minutes (maybe it was longer) and a few times I squatted to relieve my legs a bit.  The gal at the counter apologized and put 2 'Solitaire' tags on my bags (will upload pic when I get back to Seoul so you can put your color printer to good use and make a few of your own) that basically put them on par with business class for unloading.  Nice.  The meals on the flight were good, there were lots of good movies and, as usual, they gave me one of those sleeper masks when I asked for it (in business it's automatic, but if you ask in economy you'll get one).  Upon arrival in Vancouver I saw a rare sight, the customs area was packed!  A cruise was in port and normal flights all bunched up to.  Not to worry, though, as just as I approached the line they opened another area of inspectors...and in about 10 minutes I was picking up my bags.  To top it off my cabbie spoke English (something that eluded me in Seoul and Vancouver much of the time) and we had a pretty cool conversation about life, marriage and cultures.  (He too believes that once you stop looking for a spouse you'll meet them...a little wisdom for you single-but-lookings out there.)  My phone can take pictures here but needs a special chip to connect.  I forgot its charger and extra battery, and already ran down the old one...so that's the only blotch on this trip so far; which ain't too bad.  I've decided to start to teach him my limited French...which should keep him on his toes.  He's already got some of the accent down when he speaks baby-talk.           "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"23,June,2004","             When I was in Seoul these last few months I thought my wife had it kinda easy here with 'just' our 2 kids to take care of.  Now I know that this parenting thing is pretty tough.  The worst thing is they 'tag team' us.  For example, one stays up til 3:30AM, the other wakes up at 7AM.  One has a nap, and the other gets hungry.  And my wife isn't into lots of crap food for them, too...so she is constantly cooking and preparing wonderful delicacies like 'rice brocolli cheese tofu cakes' and 'seaweed and beef soup'--sounds great, eh?!  Well, the kids like it and I guess it's good for them.  When I go back to Seoul I know I'll miss these days (and nights) and start my old routine of 6PM rollerblading and going out to the bars on the weekends (maybe even during the week a bit, as my  urlLink CFA  test is finished for a few months).  I know the days will be a little less full without my 3-year old jumping (from the couch) onto my stomache/back/gonads...ah, how can I survive?  We will have the webcam and daily phonecalls to make things a bit easier, but it won't be the same.  Ug, so tired now...it's past 11PM and I know tomorrow will be busy...and the next day too.  My bud of almost 25 years is coming to visit and I'll make the trip to the ferry terminal to pick him up and the new place is now inconveniently 60 minutes from the docks compared to 30 minutes for our old place.  No matter, I imagine I'll relish the time alone on a simple car trip.         "

Things to miss about Canada:  urlLink no pollution  (or not noticeable, at least); good mixed drinks (like Dr. Pepper and Long Island iced teas, although that's changing in Seoul now); our complex's pool just 5 minutes away (and it's usually just us or a few people there);  urlLink burgers that are not served raw   (hellloooooo! heard of e-coli?).  Things not to miss about Seoul: drunk guys pissing in the streets at night (well, I am one of them sometimes); people always thinking I'm crazy for not liking tofu; paying like $10 for enough ground beef for 2 hamburgers; having to go to the foreign food section to get my M&Ms.  Things not to miss about Canada: line-ups and cover charge at almost every good bar; larger Canadian chicks (hey, no flamings, please); union leaders who think someone should make $20 an hour to pick up trash when Korean 60-year-old men do it in Seoul for like $100 a month; Vancouver rain in the winter...and spring...and fall...and summer; high (14.5%!) sales  urlLink tax ; tips treated as if they are expected (no matter the service); having to go to the foreign food section to get my ramen noodles.

3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"01,July,2004","             This may be a long blog...got a lot of thoughts going through my head this last couple of days, not least because of my reading  urlLink A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market --a very cool book and one that I wish I read before embarking on the  urlLink CFA  designation exams (wrote 2 of the 3 required exams already).  Anyhoo, went out for some drinks last night (yes, Thursday night, a school night, but I really wanted to break this jetlag and I find that going out is one of the most effective, and most fun, ways to do so) at a little place called Han's Sausages near Hong-Ik University (usually referred to as HongDae).  So upon ordering the bratwurst and beer I noticed something interesting, the beer came in a special pitcher that has dry ice in a compartment in the bottom of it and passages that allow the vapor to flow to the top and escape.  Pretty cool idea, and I had seen it before in another bar in Sinchon (another teen/bar district near HongDae).  While out on the town I started to think, 'What are the odds that I know someone here in this bar or meet them on the street?'  Likely pretty low, but then I remembered the last night I came here and got a call from an old co-worker who was basically 2 blocks from me and had just had &#49328;&#45209;&#51648; (san-nak-ji, living octopus) in a little place that we almost went to (now that was interesting).  Then I remembered that a friend of mine's former girlfriend is in Korea--not Seoul, in Pusan. But her sister-in-law's friend is engaged to a Korean girl in Daegu who often comes to Seoul (HongDae/Sinchon specifically) to see friends.  So, what if one of the thousands of people I saw were one of those friends?  How many  urlLink degrees of separation   is that?  Two to the Pusan friend (or one, if you count that I know her now), plus three to the groom-to-be (or two as the Pusan friend already knows her sister-in-law) and two more to the friend(s) in Seoul.  So that's 4 to 7 degrees, not bad.  I could also suppose that the people on the street know my wife or one of her friends (as she went to school there) but we are older than these kids and it's not quite as interesting a story as going to Vancouver then Daegu then back to Seoul.  Another area: yesterday I met some guys from an asset management firm here (for business).  One spoke quite good English, and when he found out I was from Vancouver he noted that his brother-in-law is living here.  As well, the owner of the  urlLink &#49340;&#44228;&#53461;  (samgyetang, ginseng chicken soup) place across from my apartment has a home in a suburb of Vancouver. What are the odds of that?  Now let's deconstruct this a bit, and take a bit from my current reading (and suspend for a bit the idea that I have incredible selective memory and am merely drawing connections from random events).  On the beer: both restaurants were in the same relative are (more or less) and it makes sense that a seller of those dry-ice pitchers would service both of them.  For the people on the street: the university district is full of school kids, school kids are not (usually, especially in Korea) destitute poor and they are (by definition) educated (or nearso) and it is the well-to-do and educated that end up going to foreign countries and meet/marry foreigners (there are exceptions, just humor me for a bit).  Thus, it makes some sense that I (who knows many educated people in Korea and Canada, as I am one myself) would have an ok chance to have some connection with similar people in another country, no matter the whereabouts.  (This reminds me of when I spent a month in the Philippines with my bud Carlo who met a friend there who ended up being his distant relative. Especially in places where the economic/social strata is well-defined the 'top 1%' seem to flock together.)  Concerning the people who have ties in Vancouver.  Proximity is one factor, and wealth is another.  Vancouver is the closest airport to Seoul (one hour longer to go to San Francisco) and it also has an inviting climate and seems to attract the wealthy from many countries (including the U.S.).  So it makes sense that these, again, well-to-do and educated people would have some connection to my other home.  What's my point and how does it lead to a better understanding of Korean culture?  It's this: When you meet a Korean (or when they are  urlLink on their first dates ) they will always ask questions to  urlLink figure out if they have some connection  such as  urlLink age  and ethnicity or school ties or anysuch thing that could prove a connection.  For foreigners this kind of questioning is sometimes seen as rude, but this is just a part of Korea: you get used to it.  This is one reason that Koreans study their butts off to go to the best/largest schools such as  urlLink Seoul National University ,  urlLink Korea University ,  urlLink Ewha Women's University  and  urlLink Yonsei University  and then put themselves through incredible stress to get into major companies such as  urlLink Samsung Group .  It's because after all that study and hard work one will have instant camaraderie with fellow alumni and, thus, be able to move to Vancouver when they retire and not have to work selling dry-ice beer pitchers to every bar in Korea.         "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"01,July,2004","             I've always thought of Seoul's  urlLink subways  as a real joy to be on. They are clean, fast, efficient(more or less) and CHEAP.  Buses, on the other hand, are a bit of a mystery to me.  I take one bus regularly, but that's it.   urlLink taxis , however, are plentiful, cheap and (once you know a little Korean) pretty easy to use.  Now things are getting a lot easier and logical.  As of today (July 1st) rates will be based on distance traveled rather than number of rides.  This makes sense as it always irked me when you had to pay again to transfer from one bus to another or from the bus to subway (this doesn't happen in Vancouver).  The new system just has you pay for the length of each little trip.  As well, my phone will be able to house my T-Money so I don't need to carry change or fish around for my wallet or 'stored-value' ticket.  (It can even be used in convenience stores and cabs soon! And carry up to 500,000 won, or about 435USD)There's also a color-coding scheme to the buses which may or may not make things easier.  Unless they have little maps on the buses I think most foreigners will find the new system about a confusing as the old, but a lot of that has to do with the language and familiarity with a city/district that covers many, many square kms.

Hongdae, Sinchon and Daehak-ro make a name for themselves by being close to the major universities; Kangnam is a place for lavishing high-priced liquors and girls on clients; Itaewon is near the US Army base, so it's a haven for GIs and other English-speakers (who seem to have more money than brains sometimes, myself included) and Sincheon is a teen district as well, in the well-to-do area of Songpa-gu.  My latest foray was to Daehak-ro (daehak/daehak-kyo means college/university, ro means street).

I don't know if he was doing it for my benefit or to show-off to the Koreans around him (Koreans sometimes show that they know English as a form of one-up-man-ship...it shows they are educated and studied a lot, no matter how brutal the usage).  He was saying such things as 'Excuse me, could you calm down?' (actually, he said that A LOT) and 'I'm sorry' and 'Okay!'.  I think he was practicing to be a bar bouncer or something.  Anyways, these guys got pretty loaded.  When one of them was away from the table it looked like the other two were a little amorous (Korean men sometimes hold hands or put their arms around each other, especially after a gallon of soju).  I snapped the picture below before we left.       urlLink     2 guys who really like each other (but they are not gay).   Then when we finished walking nature was calling me...but not #1.  I took a look into the  urlLink hwa-jang-shil  (bathroom) in the restaurant, but it was a squat-type.  Then we came across this theatre (below...oh, and Koreans usually pronounce theatre and Seattle the similarly).  It was new so I took a look.  Man, that bathroom was spotless--maybe it looked so good because I figured that all of the ones in the area were squatters or brutally dirty affairs, as they usually are in smaller, older buildings (man, how do these women do it?).  Anyways, that's the tip.  Look for the newest, hippest building (especially ones with Western food or themes inside) to find the best W.C. (another way Koreans denote watercloset).   urlLink     Fantaseum   Since Korea has millions (ten of millions, likely) of cellphones (handphones, as they call them) you'll find public pay phones only in a few places: the airport, the train/bus stations, major hotels and the subways.  (Well, I've seen them on the street sometimes, but not that often, and not when you need one.)   urlLink     phones   Another instance of Korean marketing gone bonkers.   urlLink Red Mango  is a major bing-soo (shaved ice garnished with fruit and stuff and then topped with yogurt or ice cream).  But the tagline for the firm is a little....well, weird 'Start loving myself!'.  When I explain it to people they really get confused.   urlLink     Red Mango  Another thing here that's funny is girls wear shirts that say '69', it's a brand here but they are oblivious to the hidden meaning (if you don't know I can't explain it here, this site is family-friendly).  Or church-going girls will have a Playboy scrunchie in their hair...not knowing who 'The Hef' is.  Koreans also have no idea the multitude of words we have for a part of the male anatomy (so the scene in  urlLink Austin Powers  where they say 'woody, Johnston, boner, balls, willi...) goes over most of their heads.  They have one word here for it  urlLink go-choo  (hot pepper), and they're pretty surprised to learn that their word for 'ward' in a city (dong) is also another euphemism for gochoo.   urlLink     And, to cap it off, in the subway there was a guy taking a snooze right on the floor.          "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"09,July,2004","             Some of you may remember my first article on oh-gyup-sal (five layers of fat pork). Oh-gyup-sal is a one-up on sam-gyup-sal (three layers of fat porl), so it only makes sense that this land of hyperbole would come up with chun-gyup-sal (1,000 layers of fat pork)--and it did.  As amazing as it may seem, someone got the great idea of leap-frogging all of the competition and calling what is basically pork chop a name that denotes something a little more superlative.  Why not trillion layers of fat pork (jo-gyup-sal)?  I have no idea.   urlLink     The sign says '1,000 layers of fat pork'...mmmmmmm.   Well, Korea isn't the only place where things get blown out of proportion sometimes, it's just that they do it so well here and we're not used to it.  Who can forget the launch of the  urlLink Gilette Mach 3 ?  Yes, that's what I need!  Three blades on my face!  (Of course they had 'Excel' versions of their Sensor, Mach 3 and ladies' razors, too, as if we needed that little white strip to save from cutting our faces open.)  Recently the  urlLink Schick Quattro  came out (for those of you who failed Latin, Italian, Audi or whatever language this is in: quattro means expensive).  Now Gillette has a 'power' version of its razor.  Now this is getting ridiculous!  Here in Korea I get 10 good razors for 2,000 won (USD 1.75).  (Yes, 17.5c each!)  They're so cheap I only use them twice then throw them away.  (Please no Greenpeace/eco-friendly group flamings.)  And you know what?  I get a pretty good shave out of it, too...similarly I only buy plain ol' pork chops at home.         "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"08,July,2004","             Sometimes this place really makes me think.  So many things are so different here (language, expressions, people, culture, shopping, driving habits) but, yet, some things are just like home.  Take my building, for instance, there are a few guards (we call them 아저씨, ajeosshi, or 'mister') in the lobby...well, they're no so much guards as they are greeters, like at Wal-Mart (neat article  urlLink here ).  After they figured I was not a visitor, but a long term resident of Seoul they started saluting me, waving and saying 'Morning'.  Huh, morning?  Ok, I guess they learned that greeting somewhere. Many Koreans in lower-level jobs know absolutely no English and what they may have learned these old timers probably had long forgotten, so I appreciated the effort.  Then I was inline skating (rollerblading to those of us who can pronounce it easily) one lovely 4AM and another 아저씨 said 'Morning!'.  Ok, that's two.  Interesting.  Then I got to thinking (well, it came to me while watching a Kia ad) that Morning is everywhere in Korea.  This morning (there I go again) I saw a give-away paper called 모닝 (Korean phonetic of morning) and then recalled the ad for  urlLink Kia's sub-compact car .  A simple search on Google Korea came up with more: an  urlLink online bookstore , an  urlLink online flowershop , a  urlLink golf site  and a  urlLink news organization .  Then there's  urlLink Good Morning Shinhan , one of the largest secutities dealers in Korea--with its flagship building in Yeouido, one of the largest in town and flaunting its name, albeit in Hanguel/Korean text, for all to see.  And, of course, this is the 'Land of the Morning Calm'. I could go on, but you get the point.  'Morning' is not without it's detractors, though.  About a year ago there was a major scam where a real estate developer conned million from many small investors.  One lady summed it up well saying, 'Now I know what it is like to go from a rich person to a begger in one day.' Definately not a good morning for her.  As an aside, apparently another Western idea is hamburgers, and in NORTH KOREA, no less.  (JoongAng Article  urlLink here .)  Here's your factoid for the day: although most words are pronounced and even used differently than the original, Korean has incorporated about 10,000 English words into its language; much like Tagalog/Filipino has a lot of Spanish and we Westerners are comfortable with Bon Appetit and Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto.         "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"07,July,2004","             A readers will know, shopping in Seoul is a little different from back home (assuming back home is a Western country like Canada, the US, UK...).  For one thing ( urlLink more things here ), you can haggle at almost every 'store' (and some for sure at every place that is not a store, but like the picture below). This includes the 'department stores' like Migliore, Doota and Hello ampm that are in Dongdaemoon (each area actually stalls of independent sellers) but not such high class/price places like Shinsegae or Lotte Depart.  There is also no haggling at Lotte Mart, LG Mart nor E-Mart, but in those places you're getting a bit better surroundings than the true discount stores.  Anyways, I find that haggling is a bit of an art...and it takes a little while to get the hang of it.  After a while you'll wonder why you don't get a discount back home, though.  (There is also  urlLink no tax  on purchases; it's either included in the price or just not paid--especially at street-sellers.)  Like today, I went to Namdaemoon for some shopping, had to get a few undershirts and towels.  I found a seller of both and asked the prices: 2,200 won for a shirt, 1,700 won for a towel...no discount.  Huh, ya, right.  I offered 16,000 (compared to the 16,800 total price...this is NOT a big discount, just 5%, but I was in a hurry and didn't have 5 minutes to haggle for $1.50 off).  She said, 'no discount' again, but I said (in Korean) 'I'm buying 3 of these and 6 of these, discount!' and she relented.  Oh, it helps if you can do simple math in your head (the seller sure as heck can) and if you know enough Korean to at least  urlLink say the prices in Korean .  Otherwise you're a bit of a mark.  Now for this picture.  This 'store' popped up literally right on the street near my work and the sellers were luring the office girls to try on their lovely selection of shoes.  No guarantee, but for $10 a pair and the way fashion trends have the life of a gnat here who cares?   urlLink     Get your ladies shoes right here!            "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"06,July,2004","             Recently I downloaded Go-Stop (a traditional Korean card game, played almost exclusively by men, Yahoo!'s version is  urlLink here ) to my phone.  (There is one called Sexy-Go-Stop too, for those who are into Anime.)  Well, I've been playing it (the clean version) so much that my battery dies sometimes when I'm out (is this an addiction?).  The last time was out at the movie theatre (the MMC in Dongdaemoon is open 24 hours, if anyone is looking for a flick at 3AM).  A friend of mine said they have chargers at convenience stores (I also remember them at some restaurants too).  Then we found that they had them at the theatre, too.  The young kids there knew how to hook up the battery...they were really helpful, actually.  Koreans are so nice sometimes.  Here's a pic of what to look for if you're in Korea and your phone goes dead.   urlLink     You stick your battery in here for about 5-10 minutes and it's powered up (but the charge wears down more quickly, I think).   More things I like in Korea: delivery services.  I ordered a few books from  urlLink Seoul Selection  (a great foreign bookstore that has an interesting  urlLink newsletter  that's worth subscribing to--it's free).  Anyways I ordered online at 3:00PM. The order showed up at my door at 9:30 the next morning. This would not happen in Canada unless you paid extra for delivery, and even then it'd maybe be 2 nights as I ordered late in the day.  Korea, though has a ubiquitous number of  urlLink quick service delivery services  (as they're called).  This means it takes about 1-2 hours for a package to get across town because a motorbike courier takes it rather than taking it in a van to a sorting station then another van for delivery.  (It's similar to the bike couriers that we have in the West, but no one bikes on the roads here.)  I also like the way Korea updates things.  The pics below show one example.  In the old days there was a rarefied breed of warrior who guarded the main palaces and nobles, today there is another (decidedly more leggy) version.  (Um, this is a joke, for those who believe everything they read.)   urlLink     Changing of the Guard and Twirling of the Rifles.          "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"05,July,2004","             One of my favorite places in 여의도 (Yeouido) is  urlLink Wingswing  located on the second floor of the building behind the Lexington (formerly the New Manhattan) Hotel.  It's run by the son-in-law of a Korean who spent 20 years in New York and Atlanta running similar places...and now the old man is here to revamp it.  They added 2 bar counters and hard liquor (and recipes) as well as more to the menus (spaghetti, quesadillas).  Last time I was there I had Crown Royal (oh, how I love it) and the time before they served us this Flaming Dr. Pepper which is a shot of Bacardi 151 in a glass of beer.  It's not as tasty as the version I know (Amaretto shot in a 50/50 beer/Coke mix) but not bad.  Probably one of the few places in Seoul you can get some of the booze this place has--and the only one in Yeouido.    urlLink     Flaming Dr. Pepper at Wingswing          "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"04,July,2004","             Over the last few weeks I've been to a couple of Western movies ( urlLink Troy  and  urlLink Spiderman 2 ) and a few Korean ones as well:  urlLink 여친소 (Yeochinso/Windstruck) ;  urlLink 올드보이 (Old Boy) ;  urlLink 공공의적 (Gong-gong-ui Jock/Public Enemy ;  urlLink 와일드카드 (Wild Card) ; and  urlLink 범죄의 재구성 (Beomjwi-ui Jaegooseong/The Big Swindle) . I really liked all of the Korean movies (actually the Western ones seemed pretty predictable compared to the Korean fare) but found it interesting that 4 of the 5 (all but Old Boy) were cop movies. (To be fair, in The Big Swindle it was more about the robbers than the cops--still, the theme was intact.) Maybe this is typical to movies in general (going in phases, all of the movies are from the last year) or maybe it's just how (again) in Korea things are very much fads; where once a theme gets started it's difficult to stop it.    urlLink     Public Enemy, WildCard, The Big Swindle and Old Boy    With that in mind, I think of my night out on Saturday. A group of friends and I had dinner and a movie in the 동대문 ( urlLink Dongdaemoon ) area then headed to 대학로 (pronounced Daehan-ro, but the Korean spelling is Dae-Hak-Ro: Daehak means university, ro is street, so (as you may have guessed) it is a street near universities--so, of course, there are tons of bars there). It was raining as a typhoon is in town (see the  urlLink typhoon tracker page  for updates of when one is on its way here) so there weren't many people out on the town. (I, however, didn't mind it as the rain here is pretty warm and I was in shorts a shirt and cut-away sneakers...really quite comfortable.) We went to about 5 places before finding one called 꾼 (Kkoon, an intersting name). The gal running the place said it was their first business day, but the place was empty. The music, however, was really good so I said, 'Service.', as in: what will you give us to come in? She offered plates of snacks and such...sold! The prices were lower than I'm used to, too...a good place.   So, how does this connect? The ambiance. The bar was like many other ones out there with tables, low lighting, club music, and a table or two that has a trough in the middle for ice and imported beer and coolers (we had 8 different kinds). I guess this is a safe business strategy as it may be fatal to go out on a limb with a new concept in this town unless it does very well, in which case you'll have lots of imitators.   I wonder what the next trend will be? Whatever it is, it'll catch on fast.  urlLink (JoongAng Ilbo article on this topic.)           "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"14,July,2004","             In any developing country (and I believe Korea is 'developing' and really only started on the road to a real economy with the onset of real elections in 1994) there can be trials and tribulations for those who lead (politicians, heads of business) and follow (workers, students).  Don't get me wrong, Korea has made gigantic strides in the last 50 years (thanks mainly to the iron-grip of their president/dictator from 1961 to 1979, Park Chung Hee) and in the last 10 years (when Korea really started to open up to Western influences)--but things are still in a state of flux here.  Business practices have changed (although they retain much of the old flavour), politics...well, politics seems to still be the same..., relationships between people has changed (albeit only a little, Koreans still follow Confucius tenets and defer to age, men and the learned) and even language has changed (as the Internet and chatting has lead to the truncation of many words).  With these changes comes inefficiencies.  One can capitalize on them or be a victim.  The lady in the BMW below may have done both.  She is likely enjoying the ride in her Z4, but (according to  urlLink this newspaper article  she is also a victim of over-pricing--something that BMW, I assume, does not mind as they can have a higher profit.  (One other part of this may be that BMW has certain 'import duties' over and above the government ones that need to be paid in order to sell their cars here, such is another inefficiency.)   urlLink     The BMW Z4...a pricey car in this town.   But what about those who cannot afford a luxury car, a flat in Kangnam (the priciest district in Seoul) and an expense account at the local watering hole?  Or worse, those who had it all and then lost it?  What happens to them?  Well, for some, the answer is suicide (hence my mention of  urlLink BASE jumping  (Buildings, Antennae, Spans and Earth) in the title.  Since there are few guns in Korea (heck, many policemen do a  urlLink Barney Fife  and don't even walk around with a loaded gun, the bullets are in their pocket!) the next best thing is jumping.  While inline skating one day near the river I saw police taking 2 jumpers from the water--ug,that was not cool.  Sorry for the imagery.  One thing that irks me about Korea sometimes is the lack of discretion in some matters (one faux pas I probably just committed above).  We know that reporting suicide can lead to more suicides, but they continue to report suicides as they happen.  Some of the stories are truly heart-wrenching and I (yes, even I) weep a bit when I hear some of them--this is not something you get desensitized to.  If you're of strong mind take a look at this article on recent  urlLink suicides .  Of course, it's not just in Korea.  In the  urlLink U.S. military suicide  is the #2 killer (I'm not sure if friendly fire or actual action are #1, you start to wonder sometimes).  The interesting thing I found from reading all of this (not that it makes me an expert by any means) is that Korea, although it may have the 4th highest suicide rate in the 29 OECD countries, it was waaaay down the list globally (Korea always wants to be #1 compared to the top nations, which is why they probably used this statistic).  Countries in Eastern Europe (although some of these 'suicides' may be underworld related), Scandinavia, and even the US and Canada, Hong Kong and Japan had higher rates than Korea did in 1994.  (From Table 1 in  urlLink this paper/abstract  In true Korean fashion, the rates here went from 6.8 per 100,000 in 1998 to 16.5 in 2000 and 18.1 in 2002...man, does everything here have a  urlLink logarithmic curve  to it?  Some also turn to  urlLink murder , such as happened 10 years ago and lately again (and I'm sure there were other cases in-between), but that's another story.  Perhaps this is just another part of living in a place where the past is meeting the future head on.          "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"13,July,2004","             Koreans have an interesting saying when referring to guys like me: 기러기아빠 ( urlLink gi-reo-gi  a-ppa, wild goose dad).  Whenever I told Koreans that I was here and my wife and kids are in Vancouver they would call me this, and now I know why.  My boss explained it to me quite well (although he called the bird a  urlLink seagull , as many Koreans do).  It goes like this: a goose flies very high in the sky (so does a vulture, but I guess that's not as poetic, nor as flattering) and has very good eyesight.  Therefore, it can see things waaaay in the distance--which is good, because that's where a 기러기아빠's family is...across the ocean.  It is used for Koreans who go abroad to work, as many do in the Middle East on the many Korean-lead construction projects there, for the many families that have the wife and kids in a foreign place (especially Canada, especially Vancouver...there are so many there) and the dad stays in Seoul, and for guys like me who come to work but whose wife likes Vancouver soooo much she can't bear to live in Seoul and put the children through such torture as is living here.  It's just another part of Korea where things that don't make a lot of sense at first seem to be clearer once you get the whole story.   urlLink     The majestic, beautiful Canada goose.          "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"13,July,2004","             This  urlLink Korea Times Business Section editorial  speaks of Jwa Seung-hee's (president of an economic research institute for the Federation of Korean Industries) 10 mysteries of the Korean economy.  #1 Western-style economic reform has eroded the dynamism of the Korean economy.  #2 Seoul has become bigger and bigger despite the government's policy of balanced regional development.  #3 The rural community's life has become dismal despite the policy of promoting the balanced development of the rural and urban communities.  #4 Income disparity has widened despite the policy of promoting egalitarianism and redistributive policies.  #5 Competitiveness of small companies has weakened despite the policy of curbing chaebol.  #6 Economic concentration has deepened despite the policy to diffuse the concentration of economic power.  #7 The exodus of primary, middle and high school students for overseas study has increased as the government seeks to standardize schools.  #8 Government control of finance has deepened amid sloganeering for financial liberalization.  #9 The Roh administration seeks to scrap the Park Chung-hee’s economic development model, which created the Miracle on the Han River. #10 The government has strengthened policies, which would erode corporate competitiveness.  To this business/economic list I'd like to add a cultural 10 mysteries of modern Korean culture, if I may.  #1 Koreans often speak of love for their children and the sanctity of marriage but many men (and women) have lovers on the side. #2 Many Korean parents (or grandparents) insist that children marry Koreans, even though they send their kids overseas to study, or to hagwons (language academies) here. (N.I.M.F.T Not In My Family Tree) #3 Everyone seems to like the promise that is living in a different country, but very few can make the move out of Korea. #4 Koreans (especially the young) love the outdoors and clean air, but they hate to live in the country. #5 Korean students hate learning English, but older ones seem to love taking English classes. #6 Even after years of incredible progress Koreans always compare themselves to foreigners: the Rodeo Drive of Seoul, the Silicon Valley of Korea, the Harvard of Korea. #7 Most Koreans seems to have a negative attitude toward U.S. soldiers here (especially those who served in KATUSA-Korean Army Training with U.S. Army) but they don't seem to want them to leave (and leave South Korea vulnerable). #8 Koreans spend 10-16 hours a day (for years on end) studying for major exams but at the end of it all don't seem to have a stored library of knowledge to use in everyday life (or even at work!). #9 Koreans are very (over) protective of their children, and yet they have few child restraint seats and no one uses seatbelts in the back seats. #10 Many Koreans have dogs as pets, but many other Koreans eat dog!  Another interesting story came to me from a friend of mine. A group of 20 or so young people were on the subway when it came to a station with about 20 older folks waiting to get on.  The kids were sitting down in the seats, but without a word or any signals they ALL stood up together and offered their seats to the older folks.  Unreal.

3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"12,July,2004","              urlLink     Paris Lovers...what a happy couple.   Looking at Korea one can see something of a Leave it to Beaver mindset when it comes to relationships--especially in the minds of 20-something girls here.  One could compare it (as I will) to a monk living life in a temple and then having everything changed when he starts to see what happens over the hills where he makes his home.    Thankfully, some movies are starting to show that life may not be what we assume.  Recently I watched  urlLink Hi, Dharma!  ( urlLink a story about a gang of criminals that hides out in a monastery ) and  urlLink In-eo Gong-ju  (literally means mermaid princess, but is translated to My Mother the Mermaid or Little Mermaid; a story about a daughter who somehow visits her parents when they first meet and fall in love).  Dharma is a comedy where the gangsters find out something about themselves within the (relative) purity of the monks and the monks gain a new perspective from their dichotic encounters.  Both learned that their so-called 'pure' states (of peace or brutality) are not perfect and they can grow from knowing one another.   The daughter in Mermaid had a revelation as well.  She hated her parents (her father seemed a dim-witted postal worker and her mother a cussing rubber/masseuse at a bathhouse).  She wished she were an orphan like her boyfriend.  An odd occurrence (I still don't know how this happened) put her back in time to when her parents met on  urlLink Jeju-do  where her mother was a diver (mermaid connection) and her father a postman.  She comes to see them in their innocence and pure state--full of dreams and potential; not the broken and bitter people they became.  A picture taken at that time shows the village in and around their first bus and her young father on his bicycle, smiling.  The daughter asks her mother why he is smiling...and in the last scene her mother says, 'Of course he is smiling, what else could he be doing?' (or words to that effect).  Yes, the young have every reason to smile.   urlLink     My Mother the Mermaid and Hi, Dharma!   Mermaid seems to show that the 'pure' state of youth and promise is a transient one and Dharma could be saying that moving from purity may actually be good (adding another dimension for growth).  This is something that some young people here don't seem to grasp...they need to have perfect grades to get into the perfect university and get the perfect job and marry the perfect spouse and have the perfect family (which means grandsons for many parents and in-laws).  Perhaps in the future less emphasis will be placed on keeping up with the Kims/Joneses but for now many still aspire to a pure and perfect dreamlife.  Of course, if they don't marry the perfect person Koreans can now  urlLink get a divorce  quite easily...which is another problem.         "

However, there is something that I wanted to comment on: you can use it to form your views or not. Oh, and I talk about some of the important points in here, so if you're going to see the movie bookmark this and read it later.    Last night I saw  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11  (click for a  urlLink local review  and a trip to the  urlLink warroom ). It was a pretty good film. I had seen a few clips from it so I had an idea of what to expect, which was kind of unfortunate. Some said 'you'll laugh, you'll cry' and I think knowing that dampened the mood a bit. It may have been better if I didn't know what to expect (and, sorry, now you know kind of what to expect so I opened a bit of Pandora's Box for you too).   When getting the required popcorn and drinks (5,000 won, 4.50USD for a large tub and 2 drinks!) I was greeted by this guy (below). I had to say, 'That's quite a get-up you got there', knowing/hoping he wouldn't understand. At the door to the actual theatre a guy and a gal in the same costume did a little salute as everyone filed in. I didn't think about them again until the end of the movie.    urlLink      Soon he'll be wearing a different uniform.    Fahrenheit 9/11 was a pretty interesting show. It tweaked a few memories I had from that day. When it happened I was in bed in Vancouver, just waking up. As a stockbroker I was wired to the daily news and had turned on my T.V. at 5:50AM. The news of the first plane was already broken and I was thinking, 'What the heck? Some moron pilot slammed into one of the largest buildings in the world? Was it a terrorist?' When the second one hit I think we all knew that it was no accident.   I watched it all that morning. Waiting for the fires to be brought under control; or maybe for another plane to hit another tower. Who could tell what might happen? It was especially surreal for guys like me, I think (egotistical, eh?). My dream, as any guy in finance would have,&nbsp;was to&nbsp;be to be in Windows on the World (the posh restaurant at the top of one of the towers) giving a high-powered presentation to the money-men of New York and the world. That dream seemed more like a death sentence now. I don't know what the emotion was, but you might say I was relieved that I didn't go to Wharton or have a CEO dad who might get me into that room on that day. Of course you didn't have to be a financier to be there, many blue-collar people (firefighters and police) and 'regular Joes and Janes' were there as well.   The next day I went to work. It was quite odd. There was little to do and there was an eerie quiet as the sounds of the harbor-planes were absent. All I could think about was the day before. I still wonder why the heck they showed the towers getting hit and then crashing to Earth so many times in the weeks following. It sure didn't help my spirits.   Back to the movie. I knew what Michael Moore was up to when he made this film. His previous works included: Roger & Me (where he went looking for the CEO of GM (Roger Smith) for answers why his hometown of Flint, Michigan was laid waste by layoffs by the firm) and Bowling for Columbine (where he looked into the psychology of guns and violence that may have lead to the Columbine shootings). I saw a show or something with him as he went all over the country promoting his newest book and noting that the employees of the bookstores were basically getting shafted by their employers (part-timers with no benefits, low salaries, fired for small errors...hmmm sounds like Korea in some ways!). Now, I'm in finance, mostly of the idea that business is good, so even though I found the anecdotes he collected to be interesting and in some cases a little unsettling it didn't really change my thinking much. (I think most of us are pretty set in our ways unless we get overwhelming evidence over a long period of time.) I knew that Moore would be going after Bush, but I had no idea how much he had on him (or at least how bad he could make him look).   Moore's 9/11 was, as a documentary should be, presented as a well-researched, factual and intellectual piece. It went into the histories of the major participants (although not much on Saddam and I was worried about how he said that Iraq never hurt an American: some of it smelled of hyperbole) and presented the facts in logical sequence. Then he threw in a curveball. He had a gal in there (a wife and mother) who, in the beginning, loved the U.S. and the armed forces a lot. She carried her American flag out each day to hang on the front of her house--careful NEVER to let it touch the ground. Later, after her son died, she hated what had happened in her country. I'll tell you the worst part was how she was given the news--it was OVER THE PHONE! I remember in  urlLink We Were Soldiers  the Army sent the notices to the next of kin by taxicab (delivered by the drivers, no less) as there were so many dead they did not have enough officers to do the job. That, I thought was a low point, but this story plumbed the depths.   Clearly, Moore was not trying merely to make President Bush look bad (he made virtually&nbsp;everyone--Cheney, Rumsfeld, Rice--look unprofessional, but he could have done that to any of us who have been in front of the camera). He could have easily made the soldiers in Iraq look like unfeeling grunts bent on discharging their weapons at anything and anyone (which, it seems, they did do at times, but that was chalked up to the adrenaline rush of being in a hot zone). No, he went at things on a bit of a different tact. He personified not only the soldiers, but something more identifiable not only for Americans but for anyone who had a loved one in any country's armed services--he made a poster child of those who are left behind (temporarily or permanently) when a service member heads off on assignment in this mother who lost her son.   The mother (pictured below) is the real story and storyteller here. President Bush is a major figure, Moore is the one who brought it all together, but its her story that hits home more than any other. No 9/11 inquiry or senate committee can take away from her and her family's loss. Her husband said it best, though, when he said, 'We are very sad to lose our son in the war, but we are more sad to know that families all over America are having the same thing happen to them right now.' (I'm paraphrasing from my fallible memory, but I think you get the point.) It's the families that suffer(ed) when 800+ troops were killed in Iraq. (We also can't forget the loss of those in WTC, a disaster that was foreshadowed specifically in Presidential Briefings.)&nbsp; For some their will to support the President and perhaps America itself may have been broken. I thought of our popcorn-seller (above) and how his family would react if he were shipped of to war, trading one uniform for another. What if my son(s) were sent off without an imminent threat, as we had in WWII and other 'respected' wars? How could you be proud of a country that did that to its children?    urlLink      Who is the main character in Fahrenheit 9/11? President George W. Bush? Michael Moore? or the mother of a fallen soldier?    So, what is next? Will there be a sequel in a few years? Perhaps Fahrenheit 38 Degrees? (Meaning the parallel of latitude that splits North and South Korea, and translated to Celsius that's just 3.3 degrees--close to freezing, kind of a cold war, which is what we have here: a war, but no open hostilities.) I doubt, after all this, that Bush (or any U.S. President for the next while) has the political muscle to go after North Korea, and that's just fine by me. Heck, if anything happens Seoul is within range of the North's artillery (!), to say nothing of any missiles they may have that could get airborne (and if the U.S. says they don't have the capabilities I'm inclined now to think that maybe they do).   Some things are different in Korea. For one, the two Koreas are still, technically, at war. Only an armistice (or cessation of open combat) was signed, not a peace treaty. I read the North signed it but the U.S. declined to sign it--hearkening to Moore's idea that the military-industrial-political complex needs a 'constant state of high alert and confusion' to reach its aims (which are, mainly, focused on money).    I'm going to digress for a little bit here, sorry.  Much of what we know as culture can be traced back to war. For instance, the Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford that former President Bill Clinton received was founded by  urlLink Cecil Rhodes : one of the wealthiest and most powerful men of his time (so much so that the country of Zimbabwe's former name is Rhodesia, named after him). He made him money from exploitation of South African diamond mines--a country which was finally conquered by the Boer Dutch in 1902, the same year Rhodes died. As well, the respected  urlLink Nobel Prize  was founded by Alfred Nobel who made his money from a little product he invented: dynamite/T.N.T. A technological triumph that is best known as 'the thing that makes things blow up', as an explosives expert might put it.    Back to Korea.  Here there is really no question of whether the leaders are looking out for the people or themselves. A  urlLink recent article  reported that 74% of respondent to a survey of Koreans said they believe politicians are law-breakers. Maybe the same is true in the U.S., but 74% pretty much tells you that people here don't need a Michael Moore documentary to know what goes on behind closed doors. (I'm not sure if that is a good thing.)   The difference here, though, is the threat. As I said, there is still a war going on. South Korea has a mandatory term of military service for all male citizens with an  urlLink 18-month jail sentence  for those who do not comply (of course with a criminal record comes no chance of a job with the government or any larger company, so it's actually more of a life sentence). In the U.S. service is voluntary, it may be seem coerced given the salespitch of the recruiting officers, but it is, in the end, voluntary. Those who are in the service and do not want to be (re-)deployed to a place like Iraq are subject to court martial and possible imprisonment. Again, the difference here is North Korea has been saying for over 50 years that they are the real rulers of the Koreas and they will take back the South; while Iraq did not make (according to Moore, I'm not sure about this point) threats toward the U.S. North Korea also does not have any resources (something that can't make the economy in that non-trading country very viable).   Anyways, this is a record blog length for me, and I'm glad you came along for the ride. My last word is simply that after Moore's 9/11 movie I think many people, myself included, will start to ask more questions and make creating such wars (if I may go so far as that) harder to do in the future...and that, I imagine, was its intent.            "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"22,July,2004","             Korea is, as you may have guessed, a hyper-competitive place. Once a store, restaurant or whatever they always make a big deal of it. One of the best ways they have to get attention is dancing girls. Ya, you heard right. Girls in cheerleader-like outfits dancing up a storm to hiphop in front of a balloon arc and inflated animals of some sort. It's really quite a sight. When my cousin visited here last year we saw 2 or 3 of these things...his 20-year-old brain was probably about to overload. This display I saw in Namdaemoon as I did some light shopping (actually I needed more hankies as mine was soppign wet from the heat & humidity here these days). Have no idea what this store is, but I was sure tempted to take a look. (Guess the marketing works.)    urlLink      Welcome to the Grand Opening of...um...I forget...where am I anyways?    Then we have  urlLink Bricx , a little place I've walked past but didn't see a reason to enter...maybe now, however.    urlLink      I'm not one for anime usually, but this one...    It took me a while to read it correctly. Usually they say things like 'free drinks (upon paying cover of 20,000 won)' or something. I know  urlLink Ohoo/Hodge Podge  has free drinks for ladies on Thursdays from 10-midnight, but this one is a little more interesting. All gals in bikini tops get free drinks at Bricx on that night...hmmmm. I wonder what they'd do if I showed up in my bro/manzeer.   Finally, take a look at  urlLink Seoul Pub's  video on  urlLink 'Picking up in Seoul'  on  urlLink Seoul Scene's website . It's pretty corny...but mostly funny. The Aussie in the rugby jersey is a regular there (I mean like every night, which is probably why he's featured so prominently).&nbsp; They've got another one called  urlLink Bondaegi Challenge  in which unsuspecting passer-bys are asked to eat....ready for this?...steamed silkworm larvae. It's actually quite well liked here.     UPDATE:   I didn't make it to the Bikini Party, but here are some pics taken at it:  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .            "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"21,July,2004","             I was going to hold off on writing this until I had a ton of pics of some of the public  urlLink washrooms  they have here, but I had a pretty brutal experience in one today so I figured that was a sign or something. Here's a restroom to avoid: near Line 4 at Seoul Station Subway...unreal. As soon as I walked in I noticed the floor was dirty, which is normally ok, a little dirt isn't the end of the world. Then I noticed a pungent odor...really brutal, actually. If I didn't have to go so bad (#1) I might have bolted, but instead I just let it go...man, did I regret that. I tried breathing through my hanky, but it didn't work, the smell permeated everything. I was getting light-headed from lack of oxygen and barely made it out of there. Man, I think they cleaned that place last when Park Chung Hee was in power (1961-1979). Ugh!   Below are some interesting shot. Take special note that they were all taken from the hallway of the building, not inside the restroom. Thus, anyone walking by could not only see the empty stalls (which is a faux pas in the West as it is) but also the user of it if it is occupied. Some also have a fantastic view from outside, just in case you want two audiences.    urlLink      All of these pictures were from the hallway, not inside the actual bathroom!    The one below is interesting. This bar in Daehak-ro is the only place you can dance in the whole district (or so its sign says) but it's also the most interesting bathroom. There is a door/window right beside the urinal that opens out to the alley. It lets in a nice breeze, but makes one feel like a bit of an exhibitionist.    urlLink       On the left:  that's a door/window that looks into an alley...and anyone can look in.  On the right:  in Lotte Department Store there is a bathroom manager and worker...posh!    Many buildings have bathroom attendants but here they not only have a check-list sheet (as they have in the West in many places) but also the picture of the attendant that cleans it (I guess in case you want to pick them out of a crowd: 'Hey, don't you clean my office's bathroom?') and in the one above there is a 'manager' and attendant responsibile for the cleanliness of the washroom. If only they were at Seoul Station on Line 4's, I might not have almost lost my lunch.             "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"20,July,2004","             Ah,  urlLink the monsoon season has ended  and thus begins the  urlLink dog days of summer  on the peninsula. I promised myself that I'd never be in Korea (and especially in Seoul) for this, but it looks like I'll be here for about half of August. Oh...my....God! It will be so hot.   Many Koreans take this hot weather as  urlLink an opportunity to take time off  (what with the continued fazing in of the 5-day workweek here) and have some ice cream (there are so many awesome flavors here, priced from 500-1000 won, or just 0.45-0.90 USD!).   Of course Koreans have a penchant for doing the moderately illogical as well. Today the owner of a 한방삼계탕 (han-bang-sam-gye-tang, extra healthy ginseng chicken soup) place ( urlLink not this one, but close ) came by the office. I actually was able to use my pitiful Korean to confirm that his place is in the basement of some building and that the price was 8,000 won (7USD, not bad). Then a friend of mine said it must be because we are in 초복 (cho-bok) or the start of the dog days. Anyways, as you may know, Koreans have 2 things they need in life: to be warm and to be well fed. Samgyetang is served literally boiling hot (they even have special stoves to fire up the bowls) so you'd think it's best served in the winter...oh no...Koreans love it best in the summer (as if it's not hot enough!). Well, this is Korea, so I'll likely have a burning bowlfull at lunch with the throngs. (When I asked why Koreans like hot food in the summer the only response was: because it's good for your health.) It'll make the air conditioned office that much more inviting.  Oh, and another reason they call it the 'dog days' is they like to also have 보신탕 (boshintang) or dog soup. Yup,  urlLink they eat dogs here (read story if you've got a strong stomach) . It's the typical Korean food reasons: it's good for men's stamina (as in: stamina between the sheets, the only kind they care about) and for women's skin (gals here are a little preoccupied with good skin). Many guys, especially older ones, and 'talents' (which is what they call any celebrity, star, singer, actor) dine on dog in order to excel in bed or in front of the camera.         "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"19,July,2004","              urlLink Samsung has a new phone ...with a THREE megapixel camera.  LG and Panitec/Curitel have similar ones out as well.  The only problem is the things are about 700,000 won (600USD).  So, I'll wait a bit until I get a new phone/dica (digital camera, as they abbreviate it here).  For now, I'm having fun taking pictures of interesting things I see in this crazy place.  Like this address plate.  It says: 21, Yangmalsan, 5 gil or: building 21, sock mountain (area) 5th road.   urlLink     Building address in Yeouido aka Sock Mountain.   I asked my boss (pictured below) about why the heck a road is called Sock Mountain...it didn't make much sense, even for this place.  He told me that Yeouido use to be called Sock Mountain...why?  No idea.  Now the place is full of investment houses, the National Assembly (parliament/senate/capitol building) and (following the money) bars and brothels...no sock factories.    urlLink     My boss mixing SINGLE MALT SCOTCH WHISKY and Korean beer.   The whole office went out last night for &#50724;&#44217;&#49332; (oh-gyup-sal, or 5-layers-o'-fat-pork).  We have a new company member and, true to Korean form, that's a great excuse to have food and (a lot of) drink.  My boss, please forgive him, brought the bottle of 1950 Macallan single malt Scotch I got him on my last trip back and then (oh my God, I can hardly believe he did this!) proceeded to fill shot glasses with it and drop them in glasses of OB (Oriental Brewery, a local malt-maker) lager.  Unreal.  Now, my grandfather worked for Seagram's (and has Scottish heritage) and two of our suppliers are right from Scotland and if they saw such a travesty they probably would have throttled him--hence the pixelated face, a little taste of the witness protection program tactics he'll have to face for such an injustice to Scotsmen everywhere.  (Oh, FYI, only single malt whisky from Scotland can call itself 'whisky' minus the 'e', all others are properly spelt 'whiskey'.)  Good thing I had my cameraphone at the ready to take these breathtaking shots, eh?         "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"19,July,2004","             It's been a while.  Been busy.  Was entertaining a British friend of mine (originally from Manchester, now in K.L.-Kuala Lumpur) who has basically been ruined by Asia.  You see, once a Western guy comes here he can hardly go back to life in the West...you'll know if you're here.  Two other Aussie brothers I know had the same thing--they both work for investment banks in Seoul and Shanghai and speak the respective languages, to life is good for them, too.  (Same effect for Korean women who go to places like Vancouver, they can't bear to leave that place either.)  Anyways, his business partner (an Aussie) was in town with him too...first time...so we went out for a few nights.  Also, some American and a Dutch friend of mine and some Koreans wanted to go out too...and then a couple of nights for business...like I said, been busy.  We went to DaeHak-ro and had &#49436;&#54588;&#46041;&#54028; (seo-pi-dong-pa; seo=west; pi=(pi)zza; dong=east; pa=(pa)-jun, a Korean kind of omlette; together they are western pizza/eastern omlette) and &#46041;&#46041;&#51452; (dong-dong-ju,a kind of immature makkoli, or rice booze).  Man, was it goood.  The dong-dong-ju, it looks like porridge but tastes light (the porridge look is actually ice crystals held in the mixture, no idea how they make it so consistent).  On the way out I almost invariably take the subway.  It's fast, clean, convenient and is unaffected by the recent torrential downpours (it's monsoon/typhoon season here now).  It's interesting, some stations are a little micro-city with shopping areas (some really large), links to office and apartment buildings, restaurants and almost everything else.  They all have a few things in common: lockers (which I wondered about before, but now I've used them a few times to store things I bought--and at about $1 a day they're a pretty good deal), payphones (something you don't see a lot of overground), washrooms (some are better than others), a lotto booth and usually a little convenience store, gift shop, flower shop and/or food seller.   urlLink     Amenities: lockers, PC bang, escalators.   I don't know why, but many of the subway stops here are spruced up a bit.  They have things like (below) lighted signs on the air conditioner units, aquariums (they call them fishbanks here) and posters for the Seoul Subway Corp. that show scenes totally unrelated to subway travel.   urlLink     Subway Art: an air conditioner, a fishbank and a Seoul Subway Corp. poster   There's also art shows sometimes.  There was one for international children's art this weekend at Hyehwa station: I saw 2 good ones: one was from China and another one (aptly named Snow in Canada) was from my home country.  Ahhh...a little piece of home.   urlLink     World Children's Art: China and Canada   That's it for now...later.           "

Out every night working (here that means having drinks with friends, clients, suppliers and partners (business partners, that is, I'm not into the girlfriend scene). Thus, all I've got today is  urlLink a link to this other blog . Some funny scenes from the Seoul Subway system. Enjoy.   Oh, and  urlLink as I reported earlier , Bricx Bar had a Bikini Party last Friday. I didn't make it there, but here are some pics taken at it:  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .          "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"29,July,2004","             Ok, you're probably looking at that title and wondering what the heck the connection is. It's tenuous, but here goes. First, these are four countries I likely will not drive in (although I did drive in the Philippines, or Phil, but that was in my younger days) the first three because of the amount of nuttiness I've either witnessed or assumed is there and the last one because I don't think I'd spend much time away from the beach.   Ok, so about this Korean driving stuff. I've been here for almost 2 years and always get the question: 'do you have a car?' My answer, I think, is pretty logical. No, because (i) the subway system here is cheap, easy and pretty fast (no traffic); (ii) the bus system is not prefect, but once you know which one to take it's quite nice; (iii) our firm has a driver and  urlLink Hyundai   urlLink Equus  for visits on company business; (iv) taxis are everywhere in this city and are pretty inexpensive; (v) my work is like 20 meters from home; and (iv) driving here is not like in Canada (either I'd cause an accident here or get used to this way and cause one when I drive back home). Thus, no need for a car. Actually, I try to stay off the roads whenever possible here.   Perhaps this is for good reason, Korea has one of the highest traffic fatality and injury record in the developed/developing world. It's really quite amazing. Take a look at these articles ( urlLink here  and  urlLink here ) and you'll see what I mean. One reason is  urlLink many Koreans do not use seatbelts  (another article  urlLink here ). Even I don't, when I'm in the back seat--especially of a taxi. It's really quite odd (and scary) that I always buckle up at home but take my life into my own hands when I'm here...perhaps simply because everyone does it here.   People who do come here to drive have to get used to the rules of the road, as described in  urlLink this article  from the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. And if you hit someone the driver is almost always at fault in some respect (more on that  urlLink here ).   So, what's the connection to Greece?  urlLink Korean drivers licenses will be considered valid in Greece . I'm not sure why, it certainly isn't valid in Canada, you have to do a new test and everything there, but for some reason Greece has opened the doors for Koreans to take to its streets, probably because of the Olympics. ( urlLink Apparently Greece is famous for some crazy driving as well .) But then, isn't that a brutal time for Koreans (or any foreigners) to be tooling around town in a rental? Oh well, I'm certainly not going to Greece anytime soon, and if I did I'd probably call  urlLink George the Super-Cabbie .   So, on to Phil. I went there with a bud in December 1998 (most of this file is classified, so this'll be short). One of the highlights was driving from  urlLink Cebu City  (where Ferdinand Magellan was  urlLink beheaded by King Lapu Lapu  way back when) to  urlLink Moalboal , the noted diving spot. It was about a 3 hours trip on provincial (read: rural, goat/dog/child/rickshaw-strewn) road and on the way back Carlo was at the wheel. For some reason a dog was on the road and Carlo tried to avoid it (really, he did swerve like 3 times, the thing just changed direction again!) but, in the end, it became one with the rubber. Also, a kid jumped on the road and pointed a gun at us (I hope it was a toy, but you never know). With that I started to really question why I'd be at or near the wheel of a vehicle in Phil or any other developing country.   Carlo and I returned to Canada safely and got back to work at  urlLink RBC Dominion Securities  where we worked (did I note that we started on the same day and had the same briefcase?) but within 2 years the both of us made moves to other firms. I was in Canada a while longer before coming here and Carlo went to first  urlLink Turks & Caicos Islands  then to  urlLink Cayman Islands . He left then returned to RBC and, as you can see from the pics below, is an avid flagger, I mean flag football player.  Ya, he goes long on the field and goes short in the office.  (haha! a little finance/hedge fund humor there for ya!)   urlLink     Watch out Carlo! Looks like that big dude's got your number! Good thing it's flag football.    Right now he's Player of the Week! Way to go Carlo! His profile is  urlLink here  and his league's site is  urlLink here  (Carlo, why is the domain dot K-Y??). Oh, and ladies, too late, he has a girlfriend and a baby on the way.    urlLink     Lookin' a little rotund there, Carlo.   Well, that's the story, from crazy driving to driving to the end zone in one blog.          "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"28,July,2004","             I'd like to thank my bud Peter in Vancouver for the picture below. It shows me that it's  urlLink not just Koreans  that are into voyeurism (although the Swiss version has one-way glass so people can't see in, and the Korean versions have none such discretion, it seems).    urlLink      Is it me? Or does she look like Martha Stewart? And doesn't that look like a prison cell loo?    I was out last night on a 회식 (hwi-shik), which basically means a bender with guys from the office. We went to my favorite local haunt, Outsider. It's called a 'playing bar' in English but in Korean they call it a 양주이밴트바 (yang-joo ee-ben-t-ba, whiskey event bar). Basically, it's not a room salon but it's nicer than a regular hof (or local Korean pub). There are girls pouring the drinks but they are ALWAYS on their side of the bar (which is just fine by me).   Of course that wasn't all that we did. We had 삼겹살 (3-layer fat pork, much like backbacon) first and went to WA Bar (when you say the name it sounds like the Korean for 'come here', very apt methinks) afterward. Man, I love living in Yeouido...at least I can get home within 50 steps instead of taking a bus or cab for 20-60 minutes to get home. Sometimes I think I'm a little spoiled here...but then I remember the pollution, long hours and compulsory drinking and I figure it about evens out.    urlLink      Um, where's his other hand!??!    So, anyways, this morning I got out of bed at about 4am to do laundry (wild and crazy guy that I am). I was still drunk, obviously, and ended up not checking my shirt pocket for the namecard (that's what they call business cards here) of the new guy (the one on the left in the pic; the middle guy, Yoon, is our new recruit and the guy on the left is Jo-last name-by the way, I think Jo should have the English name of Danny or Daniel, what do you think?). So, it got washed...damn. Well, at least I know what he looks like. Him, Yoon and I are all born in the same year, but I am a few months older, so we can be friends. It's odd here, even a year or so difference and you're considered on a different plane in some respects. Jo is our junior...so we have to take care of him/get him plastered. The nice thing about being a little older is I can pull rank and make everyone drink. hahahaha! But as a 외국인 (way-gook-in, foreigner) I can also claim to be untouchable (in the good sense) if I don't want to do something. hahahaha! (But I usually do it because it's not a good idea to play the race card too much here.)   I had to get myself some coffee this morning, but felt cheap (as usual) as there is wonderful  urlLink Maxim Mocha Gold  sticks in the office. I'm sure these things are killing me slowly, but they're just sooo convenient! Also heard that  urlLink Starbucks just opened their 100th store in Korea  (in Itaewon, actually). Yesterday was it's 5th anniversary in Korea...and I remember when I first came here (about 5 years ago, actually) they were just starting. In typical Korean fashion they caught on like wild-fire (foreign, expensive, addictive...what's not to love?)   One last thing. Koreans have a special numbering system for counting things, but they can't do the same in English, it seems. They seem to think that 'th' comes after every number. My namecards say that we are on the 2th floor...well, we're not, the 치과 (chi-gwa, dentist) is on the first floor. Then today on T.V. I saw an electronic device that was labeled '2rd cable port'...at least they were trying on that one.             "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"27,July,2004","             Last night I saw  urlLink Silmido . Man, it reminded me of The Dirty Dozen. The (true) story is: the North sent a platoon (31 men) of commandos to Seoul in January 1968 to kill then-president/dictator Park Chung Hee (he was later assassinated by a cabinet member in 1979). Their plan was thwarted, but the South wanted revenge so they set up an ultra-secret crack team of 31 (always have copy, it seems) of their own. But, they didn't recruit from the general infantry or even the armed forces at all. The members of Unit 684, as it was called, were criminals on death row who (they found out afterwards) were already known as dead to the world and, thus, would not be missed if they failed (or if they succeeded).   The 31 went through extensive and brutal training on Silmido (Silmi Island) but 31 real special forces members plus a commander. For 2 years they prepared themselves physically and mentally to 'slit the throat of Kim Il-Sung' (the leader of NK at the time, and father of the current dictator, Kim Il-Jung). The time to leave and complete their mission came and they set out to Pyongyang...but at the last moment it was cancelled. The Minister of Intelligence had changed and relations had thawed between the two Koreas (I wonder what catastrophe would have befallen this place if they had succeeded). With no reason to be, Unit 684 was to be terminated.   The story goes on a ways from there, and everyone knows it..which may have been the point of the South Korean government. Imagine if a foreign power (and hated enemy) sent a team to kill President Bush or John Major...how could they just let it go. But, as in this case, how could they let it happen? This sacrificing of deathrow inmates makes sense from a political point of view. The South got to show that they were ready, willing and able to go after Kim Il-Sung, but, in the end, it would have probably put the Peninsula back in to a brutal and devastating war.    urlLink     Silmido and The Dirty Dozen: the true story is more unreal than fiction.    At least The Dirty Dozen achieved their mission...but it was just a story, maybe based on Silmido, who knows?          "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"26,July,2004","             Yahoo! Finally, after being in Seoul for almost 2 years we closed our first deal. I had almost given up on this place/market, but looks like we've go our foot in the door. Never give up is the motto here. Reminds me of a client of mine I had in Vancouver. I knew he was quite wealthy and invested in my area, but it took 2 years to get an account out of him...for $500,000. He said to me three words I'll never forget: persistance beats resistance. Man, what a lesson that was.   A friend of mine from  urlLink Geoje-do  (cool blog about teaching experiences on Geoje-do  urlLink here ) came up this weekend with a couple of buds from the Island. One (Andy) has a friend in concert promotion and they had 2 VIP tickets to the  urlLink MTV Buzz Asia Concert  (sponsored by the super-cool  urlLink iriver  company-article  urlLink here ) at Chamshil Indoor Stadium (which I think is the same as the  urlLink Jamshil Auxiliary Stadium ). Thanks Andy!   I had no idea it would be so packed. We got there just after 7PM, when it started. We read the part on the ticket about first come/first served, but missed the line about 'doors will be open at 4pm'. Whoops (Koreans probably made a day out of it and came at noon, knowing them). Well, the place was full, but our VIP friends were already in. The gal (Anne) came out and (owing to her sister who works with the Prince tours showing her the tricks of the trade) she not only got us into the stadium but into basically any seating area that wasn't already full. Thanks Anne!   The acts were pretty cool. We missed the first one,  urlLink 보아/BoA  but caught the rest. Take a look at the pics below of BoA,  urlLink Jaurim  and  urlLink Shinhwa . For all the boy bands/acts I tried to get the most masculine pictures I could for my site, but if you want fruitier ones they're all over their sites. (I sometimes wonder about these guys, but at least the girls are hot.)    urlLink      BoA, Jaurim and Shinhwa.    There were a few J-Pop and Taiwanese acts too:  urlLink Namie Amuro ,  urlLink Vanness Wu  and  urlLink Wang Lee Hom . There were a couple of others, but the names were in Chinese and I'm feeling a little lazy now.    urlLink      Namie Amuri, Vanness Wu and Wang Lee Hom.    So, as you know, Koreans love to get together and eat and drink, that's why the after-party was so cool. It was in the uber-tony area of  urlLink Apkujungdong . It's home of the highest priced real estate (and women) in all of Korea. Yes, I'm sure I saw many genuine Fendi bags and plastic bodies. The best part was the 2 free drink tickets. Ah, there's the Scot in me speaking again. The next day we hung out in lovely  urlLink Yeouido Park  (another review  urlLink here ) where we fed the birds (below). It reminded me of the flocking to the afterparty/bar/dancefloor the night before...birds of a feather and all that.    urlLink      The gatherings: concert, afterparty, in the park.      urlLink Here's another flocking ...of Koreans to the beach in Pusan. I think the caption says there are 1,000,000 people there at the beach (about 2/3 of the population of the Vancouver area). I wouldn't put it past them.   And my final comment on this topic: credit cards.  urlLink This article  on how Koreans were lured by the notion of 'easy money/credit' (fanned somewhat by the card companies' desire for market share at any cost) and hwo it almost lead to suicide for these three individuals (sadly, many of also 'succeeded' in passing on their debts to their heirs, as happens here when a debtor dies).

3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"06,August,2004","              urlLink As promised yesterday , last night I saw a Korean horror movie:  urlLink 분신사바/Bunshinsaba .  First, though, there was time to kill before the movie so a little sam-gyup-sal was in order. We went to Don Don Restaurant in Jong-no (downtown) where there was an interesting concept. It's on the fourth floor and is entirely open-air...but they still had fans and air conditioners on full blast, too. Also, the condiments (쌈장/ssam-jang or bean paste, 상추/sang-choo or lettuce, 미역국/mi-yok-gook or kelp soup and other goodies that are hand-delivered in most restaurants were self-service after the initial place-setting. This was cool for me as (i) I love 쌈장 and 상추 with my pork and (ii) we were seated  right  next to the buffet. They also cut the pork right in front of you (Koreans are always trying to differentiate themselves, especially regarding food). Trouble is, it kinda reminded me of  urlLink Lorena Bobbit ...dooough!  Next stop was ice cream at LG25 (LG's answer to 7-11...is it really open 25 hours a day?) and try my hand at shooting a Gatling gun. Not a real one, mind you, it shoots pellets. (I'd like to see how my G.I. buddies do at that one.) Of course, the place was staffed by 2 little Korean gals (all the better to lure in the men), one of which was a pretty good shot with the Beretta.   urlLink     Cutting the Pig; Shooting the Gatling; Scaring the Girls   They say that fear for Koreans is different from us Westerners ( urlLink see article ) but I think it had many similarities to the Western genre...although the setting and plot was a little different. I won't reveal too much, but let's just say that the director did a good job of creating a lot of suspense and fright in that theatre. There was one gal there who went just berserk at about every scary scene (especially in the beginning) and everyone laughed after each outburst. I think she was scared enough for the whole room. Hahaha. Just hilarious. Without that comic relief it would have been a lot scarier, I think.   urlLink     Scenes from the movie...walking...a hand...raising her face (!)...then the final scene...and afterward.   Some pics above from the film--sorry, figured out my zoom after the first couple, and the lighting, as you might imagine, was not optimal. The effects were minimal compared to I, Robot but very, very effective for this movie. Afterward I took a picture of a lighted billboard. The girl in the white dress wasn't there when I took it...she must be a ghost! Ok, that's a joke, but it sure sounds scary. 푸하하하!          "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"05,August,2004","             I came across this in my daily readings of Korean news and sites...just trying to get a handle on this place.   urlLink     The anti-traditional Korean lady...holy crap, they look strong!  And push-ups!   More pics on  urlLink the site  (it's all in Korean, but no translation needed for the images.  Now, I knew that Korean women are strong in spirit, but had not seen many like this.  Most Korean men like their gals to be smaller, weaker (well, most guys do, it's just more prevalent here) so it takes real...um....balls for a gal to go into this sport.  I don't mind it, myself.  Maybe because even when muscle-bound Korean women still look relatively dainty--at least compared to their Western-lady body-building counterparts who start to look a little horsey.         "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"04,August,2004","             Seoul is a pretty good place for outdoor activities, as long as you live in the right part of town (which I do, thank you!). There are a few parks around but 2 of the largest are Olympic Park (a massive place that I lived near for 6 months when I stayed with my in-laws when I first came here...they were right in the '88 Olympic Village, which was nice) and Yeouido Park (which was like a parking lot before they revamped it and added trees and stuff).   urlLink     View of Yeouido Core; the park at 6AM one Spring morning...gorgeous; The Great King Sejong; and, to top it off, a guy sleeping in a gazebo.   Take a look at the scene above...this is like a block from my home and work. Before the office moved to this side of the park these views were my commute everyday...a 12 minute walk from door-to-door. Pretty cool, eh? Sure it costs a bit more to live in Yeouido and there isn't a Lotte Mart (Korean Wal-Mart) to be found in the immediate area, but it's real nice here, I think.  urlLink The Great King Sejong  is credited with 'inventing', or at least causing the invention of, Hanguel (the Korean alphabet, although it's not really an alphabet, it's more a set of sounds put to writing...very scientific for back then). His name and image is all over the place, especially at schools. There is also a  urlLink book store  and  urlLink securities company  named after him. And what stroll in Seoul would be complete without seeing a guy sleeping on the ground or floor (as reported before a few times). This guy looks prepared, though. He had the presence of mind to bring a mummy sleeping bag and get himself in the gazebo (and away from the early-morning dew that is so prominent here in the Spring).  For exercise, the little that I do here, I like to inline skate (as they call rollerblading here). Take a look at these shots:   urlLink     LG Twins Building, 63 Building, and Traffic!   Here's the lovely LG Twins Building (owned by LG Group, formerly Lucky Goldstar, also owner of the LG Twins baseball team; there are rumored to be anti-aircraft guns on the top of these towers to help defend Seoul); the 63-story tall &#50977;&#49340;&#48716;&#46377; (yook-sam (6-3) bill-ding) which houses &#45824;&#54620;&#49373;&#47749; (dae-han-seng-myung, Korea Life (Insurance), aka KLI by foreigners); and a couple views of how close you can get to the traffic on this path. It actually goes under the 88 (&#54036;&#54036;/pal-pal) Highway for a ways. Ya, probably not the cleanest place to workout, but it's all we got without going 1-2 hours from here. Many people actually drive 30-60 minutes to get to  here , especially on the weekends and holidays when this place is a madhouse. On Children's Day I got a groin injury from dragging my skate so much in order to slow down for the (literally) thousands of kids on the paths.  And why exercise?  Well, there are a lot of fun places in Seoul such as Bricx (click  urlLink here  to see the Playboy Party pics...man, think I have to check this place out; wet T-shirts involved, no minors) and good ol' Ohoo/Hodge Podge (some crowd pics  urlLink here ).  More tomorrow...going to see a  urlLink Korean horror movie  tonight (with subtitles), should be interesting.         "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"04,August,2004","             Man, how do I come across some of this stuff. Anyways, there are a couple things that may help get my buds over to Seoul sometime soon (you know who you are). Many have threatened to come here, and some read my blog and may be on the verge, but this should about do it.  Here it is:  urlLink Seoul, home of the sexiest women on the planet . (Not that they have a chance at meeting them, but they are in the city limits, apparently.)  There's also the interesting theme parties they have at  urlLink Bricx Bar  in Itaewon. I've still never been to one, but the last one ( urlLink the Bikini Party ) almost got me there. The next one is a Jungle theme. Unga-bunga!   urlLink     Ok, she's not Korean...she may not even be in Seoul...but it's a mighty fine pic.   Of course if you do hook up with a Korean (especially a Korean gal) you may find yourself a victim of 'the Coupling'. I've heard it's only with married couples, but I suspect that boyfriends get roped into this look as well. Watch out.   urlLink     Beware 'the Coupling'.           "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"03,August,2004","             &#49888;&#52492; (Sinchon, an area of Seoul near &#54861;&#45824;/HongDae, or the university district) is a pretty cool place.  From Yeouido the subway is pretty inconvenient, but there's is a bus that goes there and cabs are a cheap and fast option as well.  A few times, though, especially in this warm weather, I couldn't ignore the urge to walk the 45 minutes it takes to get there/home.  It's a nice walk: flat, across a bridge (usually some nice breezes blowing by) and you get to see more of the city and its people that way.   urlLink     Smoggy view; 2 black swans; impenetrable lock; stinky garbage (peeee-yew!)   The pics above are from a recent walk.  The first is a lovely view of Seoul's smog.  This is easterly; to the west the sky was clean (owing to the west-to-east winds from the West Sea) but it was too bright to take a picture of.  Below the bridge, and fairly numerous along the Hangang (Han River) are &#48177;&#51312; (swan) boats.  People paddle around in these things, but not too often.  (The mascot of Mapo-Gu, where Sinchon-dong is, is a swan; Youngdeungpo-ku, where Yeouido-dong is, has a duck sporting a necktie as its emblem.)  In the summer months people even sleep next to the river (well, not  right  next to it) fishing, eating ramen, drinking soju, talking...typical Korean stuff.  The odd spiral pic is that of a 'lock' on a gate next to a dilapidated apartment building.  You can see that not only is it easy to open, but the material is nothing more than thin wire.  I have no idea what or who this is supposed to guard against, but I guess someone had a reason for putting it there.  While walking back home I smelled something pretty putrid.  I mean really rotten.  God-awful, it was.  Then I stumbled upon the answer (thankfully not literally), this pile of decomposing trash.  Where's a garbage truck when you need one? Actually, I take that back.  Once in Daehang-ro a garbage truck passed by and let me tell you the smell emanating from that thing was 100 times worse than a few bags on the street.  Worst thing was, it came toward us and it left a lovely stench-ridden trail of liquid behind it...fantastic if you're walking that way.  I guess that's why the trash-heaver was running so fast beside the truck--he wanted to stay ahead of the reek.  Anyways, yesterday night my friend Andrea's friend Travis came to Seoul with his Korean bride-to-be, &#54788;&#51221;/Hyun Jeong.  We went to a Korean tuna restaurant, then to 'my' Outsider (where he tried  James Dr. Pepper : 1/2 pint beer, 1/2 pint Coke, 1 shot Amaretto dropped in and downed in 'one shot!') and then it was off to Sinchon for &#49328;&#45209;&#51648; (san-nak-ji, living octopus) and &#49436;&#54588;&#46041;&#54028; (seo-pi-dong-pa, a mix of western pizza and Korean pajun/omlette) alone with &#49548;&#51452;/soju and &#46041;&#46041;&#51452;/dongdongju (literally comes from the fermentation process where dongdongju settles to the bottom of the vat and is separated from a clear moonshine-like alcohol by a thin layer of rice).  Let's just say that we had a pretty good time and Travis did quite well for a guy who doesn't drink too much: not even a hangover the next morning. But then, we got home pretty early, at about midnight; on a weekend we'd likely had been out til 4 or 6 or 8 in the morning.         "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"02,August,2004","             Forgot I had this in my phone/camera.  Actually got a series going of this dude at one of these dance video games.  Think I remember seeing them in Vancouver too, but this ones is not just feet but arms.  There are lasers or something that sense where and how he moves his arms and if it's in sync with the instructions/music.  The guy was pretty thin and the moves made him look quite gay.  I wonder if he does these kinds of actions on the dancefloor...I wouldn't if I were him, the gals in the arcade/gameroom were really laughing it up (good thing the music was really loud).   urlLink     If this guy's got all the moves why are the girls laughing so hard??          "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"02,August,2004","             There are a few ways to beat the heat here in Seoul. One is to simply stay at work, but with the government-imposed  urlLink 5-day work-week  coming into effect (and since I can't really figure out why I'd work 7 days a week) that isn't a very viable option. You could go to the beach, but it tends to get a little crowded (as  urlLink this story  attests). Or, you can go see movies. If you do, though, as I noted in a  urlLink past blog , get ready for some comedy--and I mean before the movie starts. One of my favorite theatres is the brand-new Fantaseum in Daehangro. The staff there have some pretty wild costumes. There is a Chipper's restaurant on the top 2 floors too (where apparently the food isn't so hot, but there's a magic show to extertain the kids). The Chipper's staff (even the guys) have aprons and lace collars on their uniforms, and the female theatre staff have, get this, wings. Ya, they're dressed as angels. See pics.   urlLink     Angels complete with wings and Squid...the whole squid   They also all have this cute (well, hilarious is more appropriate) little salute they do when they greet you and say good-bye. They put their left hand on their hip, their right hand up (as if they're swearing on a bible) and touch their fingertips together while at the same time bending their knees. All this they do with a smile on their face. (If you don't get my description, think of a gay Nazi doing a Heil Hitler and you'll be pretty close.) Man, the things people do for part-time work.  Oh ya, the squid is there for general interest. It's restaurant display. I've seen dishes with hacked-up squid in it, but not one with (what looks like at least) a whole squid on the plate. Interesting.  Anyhoo, this weekend I saw 3 movies...one Korean and two Western ones (not spaghetti Westerns, just non-Korean/foreign). The Korean one was  urlLink (형님들의 도시)목포는항구다  (Hyung-nim-deul-ui do-shi mok-po-neun-hang-goo-da, or Mok-po: Gangster's Paradise). It was a pretty entertaining film, although some Korean humor I'm still trying to figure out. It goes from serious to amusing to gross in like 3 frames. One scene is with these 3 minor gangsters who are so poor they have to eat dogfood, but it gives them the runs and later (when you least expect it) a serious scene cuts to them running into a single-stall public loo. Well, the senior guy goes in and prepares to blast-off (so to speak) but the seatcover falls and he lets loose on it instead of into the bowl. They show you the mess oozing from between the cover and his legs and even outside the stall where it envelopes the (bare, for some reason) foot of his junior. My God, is there anything more repugnant? These guys were kind of a show-stealer (or a party-pooper, depending on your viewpoint).   urlLink     Mokpo, Gangster's Paradise; King Arthur; I, Robot    urlLink King Arthur  was...ok. Lots of action and killing and Braveheart-like speeches, but I can only give it a 3 or 3.5 out of 5. If you've seen Lord of the Rings this one will seem kinda washed out.  I did, however, find that one of the characters, Bors, to be much like my bud from Manchester, Alex. He also resembled Alex's business partner, Mark, but I met Alex first so he gets top billing. Reading about  urlLink the actor, Ray Winstone,  I learned that the character was much like the actor and both were like Alex. Life imitating art imitating life?   urlLink     Alex Bors and Mark...which is which?   I, Robot was pretty cool. I think I may have read part of the book way back in high school (geek that I was/am). The movie had a TON of special effects in it, but (seeing as it was in the future) they all made sense. Things, for some reason, didn't seem over the top, but that may be because I've been desensitized by now. I, Robot gets a 4 out of 5...or, for those out there who are not into sci-fi, a 3 out of 5....hey, Will Smith is in it! Oh, and the naked butt scenes are equal opportunity: one of Will (but I closed my eyes for that one), one of the girl (but I told my wife I closed my eyes for  that  one).  Well, that's it...a pretty boring weekend, for once. Actually got all the sleep I needed for once. I'm sure I won't make that mistake again for a long time.          "

Or does  urlLink North Korea 's (Democratic People's Republic of Korea/DPRK) 'Dear Leader' look at least a bit like  urlLink U2 's Bono? Of course they have some pretty different ideas about human rights and the environment but I get the feeling that being in the public eye for so long, the throngs of adoring fans (well, in Kim's case adoring may be a stretch) and accompanying entourage/roadies may have made them both a little distant from work-a-day realities. At least Bono doesn't require visitors to put  urlLink flowers at the foot of massive statues of his father , though.   urlLink Here's an interesting story  that's sure to attract an obliquely-worded press release from the North.

('I'm hot...I'm hot...I'm cold...I'm cold...I'm hhhhoooottt...I'm cccooooolllld') I tape it every morning for my kids back home and try to learn a bit of Korean...everyone speaks so (relatively) slowly on the show and uses simple tenses, which is good for us gringos.  It was pretty funny seeing him...it was at Starbucks in Sinchon and I immediately recognized him (well, seeing him everyday with his two-tone hair makes him an easy mark). I was waiting for a bud and he was with a gal so I didn't intrude...but I did intrude enough to take this pic. I was going to approach him, but then I thought it weird to act like a fan for a guy who's on a kid's simple English program; but I'm sure if my friend showed up before he left I'd have done something. I'll probably hear from his lawyers soon anyways, on account of the pic. It's tough to make out that it's actually him, so I doubt any of the local rags would give me much for it...there goes my dream of paying for my trip home with a snapshot.  It's weird, you know. There are so many celebrities in Seoul (especially in Yeouido, as the  urlLink MBC  and  urlLink KBS  broadcasting firms are located here). When I went to that  urlLink party after the MTV concert  my friends said they saw lots of 'talents' (singers, comedians, actors, anyone in the limelight) but I hadn't a clue who they were.  One time I was in the gym with my &#51109;&#51064;&#50612;&#47480;/jang-ee-neo-ruen/father-in-law and he introduced me to this guy while we were in the shower...he looked quite familiar but given the surroundings I couldn't quite place him. Then I got it...he was the anchorman from KBS news (now he's the Washington DC correspondent). There's also a popular comic performing in a bar in Yeouido (I think he's a part-owner of the place) but I had no idea until my junior from work told me (he got his autograph, too).  On another unrelated topic:  urlLink remember when I said that foreigners are buying up Korean companies?  Well,  urlLink looks like they've bought about 44%  (!) of the stocks on the Korean Stock Exchange. Wow, can you say takeover? What would happen if Americans bought large swathes of Canadian companies? Oh, ya, they already have. Anyways, some Koreans are calling foul (forgetting that you can't have capitalism without capital. The craziest idea is the one to levy a tax on the investing funds...ya, right...as soon as that gets serious many foreigners'll just sell pre-emptively and pull the rug out from many of the firms (not to mention the economy) here. Of course there'd be calls to prohibit capital from leaving Korea (as there was in the Park Chung Hee era (1961-1979) when emigrants could only take about $20 with them when they left the country--although I'm sure that didn't apply to government-types). That kind of thinking would put Korea about 10-20 back from where it is (which is, in many areas, 5-15 years back from the West).  That was close, almost sounded political there. Just so you know, I don't make this blog a sounding board for my political views, however when it comes to economics and business I think I have a relatively educated and experienced opinion...so be prepared to be bored (or aroused, depending on your view of the dismal science) every once in a while.

'But what does he know? He is not ready to make decisions as an adult yet. And if he is granted too much freedom, I'm worried he'll get himself into trouble.'   Other parents of young adults agreed. They nodded their heads to the idea that the government, before lowering the adult age, should provide training and programs to teach what adult responsibilities entail - such as building up a good credit record, making political decisions and getting married.   ' What? 19 years? Kids that age aren't really mature enough to handle anything! Let alone complete adulthood,'  said one parent who asked for anonymity.   The first two seem pretty sensible, but the last one (if the name wasn't withheld) would be prime fodder for the  urlLink Tonight Show's Headlines  segment, I think.  Then there's  urlLink this article  about the capture of an ex-convict suspected of stabbing to death two police offices a few days ago.  This part deserves special attention:   As police raided the house,  Lee injured himself by stabbing his abdomen and thighs several times  while holding a child and a 48-year-old woman as hostages to resist arrest.  He was immediately sent to Ehwa Womans University Mok-dong Hospital for emergency treatment...  What?  Did I just read that right?  The suspect stabbed  himself  enough to need to go to the emergency room?  What was he trying to do?  Commit suicide so as to evade capture?!??!  Methink perhaps the (can I say vengeful?) police on the scene may have helped him guide the knife  just a bit . Maybe he did stab himself, but it sure seems weird.   urlLink Here's an op/ed  on the capture and how it was handled by the police.           "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"09,August,2004","             Ya, I'm off to Canada/Vancouver again soon...ah, to be back in the land of fresh air, real mountains and diapers. Luckily, I think my oldest boy is out potty-trained now. Not sure, though, haven't been home for about 2 months...and a lot can happen in that time.  Now that we've done a deal here my boss/CEO would have me here all of August (well, all of the year, actually) but I have to go back as it's my younger son's first birthday, or  urlLink 첫돌/Chot-dol  (they have a different name for almost everything here). For Koreans the 1st and 60th birthdays are the biggies. 1st because the child made it through the often-treacherous first year (remember, Korea used to be really, really poor...so much so that is was a 100-days celebration as well, but that is starting to become less important as more babies are living past it). 60th because the  urlLink Korean Zodiac  is similar to the Chinese one...with 12 animals (ya, I'm a pig). There are also five colors which elude me at the moment, although I know two of them are black and gold. The Chinese use five elements: metal, earth, wood, fire and water. This year is  urlLink Year of the Wood Monkey , which I guess is better than 1981... urlLink Year of the Wood Cock/Rooster . (Hehe, had to put that in there.) Anyways, at age 60 you've gone through all 12 years 5 times for each of the colors/elements...a truly magical time, I guess. Thus, by age 60 men (no mention of women) should have at least one grandchild, preferably a grandSON--one more reason to be happy that we had our oldest boy in my wife's father's 60th year!  Now about foreingers (as I/we call all non-Koreans...even in Canada for some reason). Korea ain't called  urlLink The Hermit Kingdom  for nothin'. Basically, there are very, very few foreigners here. Something like 200,000 in a country of 48 Million. Most of us are (like me) in Seoul and (not like me) teachers. Others are manual labour workers from China, India and Southeast Asia (doing the  urlLink 3D-dirty, dangerous, difficult-jobs  that Koreans feel they no longer need to perform en mass).  Foreigners (or 외국인/weigook-in or 외국사람/weigook-saram) are treated quite differently from native Koreans (and likely for good reason in some cases). We all need to register with our local 구/ku (ward/borough) office and do so (i) every 12 months or (ii) if we move to another 구 (whichever comes first). We get an Alien Registration Card that has our pic and address on it as well as our visa type (teachers are E-2, I fall under E-7 or 'other worker, director'). We need the ARC to get a job, get a bank account or do almost everything else official here. But it's not the same as a Korean Citizenship Card. Some promotions, for example the bonus card for  urlLink Fantaseum , is only for Koreans, not me. So I can't get 10% off movies or get bonus points there...waaaaaaaaa!  Also,  urlLink foreigners cannot easily buy land in Korea  (although I've also heard that it just can't be done...not sure who to believe on this).  urlLink Foreign investment companies, however, still did so --and did in great amounts after the 1997 financial crisis. (In fact, they were the first firms in Korea to EVER use due diligence/research before buying and developing land...Korean execs, it seems, did it based more on intuition than anything else before then.)  It's also hard for foreign firms to get market share here--unless they partner with a local firm such as Otis did with LG Group concerning elevators and escalators. Heck, foreign car makers have just  urlLink 3% of the local market ! (Not counting GM's recent purchase of Daewoo Motors, which is a small player anyways.)  One thing foreigners have had some success in doing is buying all or parts of troubled Korean companies. Korean firms put off foreign investment as long as possible, but in the end they  can  take on foreign investors-- urlLink 대한생명/DaeHan sengmyung/Life aka Korea Life Insurance  is 5% owned by Australia's largest bank,  urlLink Macquarie Bank . Korean firms, however are loathe, it seems, to disclose what most purchasers would consider to be important facts about the businesses.  urlLink 교보생명/Kyobo Sengmyung/Life  apparently had months of due diligence done on it by  urlLink buyout firms , but in the end not enough was known to do a deal. Foreign firms have been able to  urlLink buy billions of USD in Korean stocks ,  urlLink SK Life ,  urlLink large portions of Korean banks ,  urlLink other firms  and one ( urlLink PCA ) is  urlLink in the running  to buy  urlLink 대한투자증권/DaeHan Tooja Jeunkwon/DaeHan ITC/Investment Trust Company aka Daetoo  (names here can get pretty long and complicated) though, so there is some opening up of this place.  Funny, the longer I'm here, the more normal all of this seems...not sure that is a good thing.          "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"09,August,2004","             Ah, finally...someone else I know is coming here from Canada for a visit. First was my cousin, Lars in May of 2003. He came at the perfect time. Weather was getting warm, but not unbearably hot and  urlLink Children's Day and Buddha's Birthday  were celebrated (day off) during his time here too. That was cool. Here are some pics from his visit. We did almost everything you could as a tourist for a short visit (but light on the bar scene as I was not as educated as I am now on it...and he was so young and impressionable at the time).   urlLink       Welcome to Korea...you must have SARS; Seoul City Hall traffic square;  urlLink Myoungdong  on the weekend; kids and wooden swords @ Korean Heritage Museum; us at the  urlLink Korean Folk Village ; on  urlLink the bus  heading to  urlLink Incheon Airport .   He had a fever (from a normal cold) a few days before he got here, so that and the general lack on English language ability by almost everyone here lead him to be delayed getting out of the airport by over an hour. Next time I'll give my visitors a little note in Korean to show the airport staff saying: 'I'm a top gamer from _______ please make sure I don't miss my tournament and speed me through customs quickly.' or some such thing--Koreans love their online games here; they even have a TV station dedicated to it.  Lars had this to report about Korea (and he's flown about 1,000,000 miles thus far): it's similar to Europe, but just LOTS more people.  The second person was a guy I met through a teacher in  urlLink Pusan/Busan  I know through a friend of mine in  urlLink Nanaimo  (my old roommate, actually; funny how things seem to dovetail as we get on in years). Anyways, her sister's bud is getting married to a gal in  urlLink Taegu/Daegu  and wanted some pointers on how to not screw-up in front of the in-laws-to-be. He was here for a week or so and in Seoul for a couple of days...but I think  urlLink we crammed a week of drinking into one night .   urlLink Yusheng  should have a good time here and should be here sometime in the fall, date to be determined. The guy's some kinda world traveler and he takes  urlLink some pretty cool pic of architecture  wherever he goes. I've noticed that many of them are devoid of human presence...something he'd be challenged to do in Seoul. There's always people around you here no matter the time or place. If you want to see some cool shots of my other hometown, Vancouver, take a look  urlLink here .  Ok, time to get my  urlLink pubmaps  out and plan Yusheng's course.          "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"08,August,2004","             I think if I'm going to claim 여의도/Yeouido as my new hometown I should know something about it...and by extension you should too. I've got a little more to add to my  urlLink background on it thus far .  As you may know, ~do can mean two things in Korean. One is: province, such as 경기도/Kyunggi-do. The other is island, such as 제주도/Jeju-do (also spelled Cheju-do, depending on what era the map or publication was edited in...things changed in 2002, just in time to confuse the heck out of tourists coming here for the World Cup). Since Yeouido (also spelled Youido, Yoido and Yeoido) is pretty tiny and part of 영등포구/Youngdeungpo-ku (ku is like a ward or borough such as Queen's or The Bronx) the ~do here signifies that it's an island. I had no idea that its ~do was 'island' because it looks as though they've filled in or paved over much of the water that once separated Yeouido from the mainland.  Anyways, way back when Yeouido used to be on the outskirts of Seoul and it housed the countries first real airport. (Later  urlLink Gimpo/Kimpo Airport  was built in the new outskirts of Seoul and now, since the city is not getting any smaller,  urlLink Incheon Airport  is the new International airport for Seoul; although Kimpo still handles much of the domestic traffic.) In fact,  urlLink Yeouido Park , which until 1996 or so was a slab of pavement instead of the picturesque park that it is, was the runway of that airport! So, here in West Yeouido, near the park, is where the streets are named 양말산/Yang-mal-san or 'sock mountain'. I got to thinking why it would be called sock mountain...there wasn't a sock factory here to my knowledge and I hadn't heard a story about removing one's socks for any reason (although I wouldn't dismiss it if I heard it; there are so many different traditions here). When I heard about the airport I came up with this theory: sock mountain is the hill (here they call a mountain what we in Vancouver would call a knoll, I find) where  urlLink the windsock  was placed. Make sense?  For more exciting and ground-breaking news stay tuned to this blog.          "
3581210,male,33,InvestmentBanking,Aquarius,"08,August,2004","             Being gay in Korea is like being gay in the U.S. military...in 1950. Let's just say that it's not near as lovingly embraced as in the West/US. Gays marrying in Korea? C'mon! There are no Korean gays! Of course, if one is gay one can hardly be Korean. I'm not trying to piss of PCers out there, this is just the way many Koreans (especially men and older ones) think. Although the younger generation are more open to other ideas, it's the older generation that controls politics, education, finance, and even media and culture to a large degree. The CEOs of the TV stations are all men and all old guys, as an example.  Things are changing, though, as evidenced in this poster for a gay bar in Itaewon. (Now that you know its name you can either (i) know where to go or (ii) know where to avoid depending on your preference.)   urlLink     Yikes!   Here are a few websites on gays in Korea:  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .  urlLink This blog  has a tongue-in-cheek explanation of what being gay is...basically a primer in ' urlLink gaydar ' (how to recognize a gay in Korea or elsewhere). However, I think that many of the guys here have gay characteristics. It's pretty weird sometimes. In a business meeting one guy from a partner firm put his hand on my leg (just above the knee) as he spoke of my experience in finance and what I do for the investment process. This would be outrightly gay, but in Korea it's ok...it just shows (non-sexual) fondness and a measure of trust between two people. My boss does it also...much to the surprise of foreigners in our group...but, again, it's not 'gay' its just the culture here. My wife's uncle holds my hand, too...and not for 2-3 seconds; for 2-3 minutes. At first I thought it was pretty weird, but it just means that he really likes me. (Having said all this I know I'll have to put up with a deluge of gay jokes when I see my buds back in Canada, crap.)  Over here guys touch guys and girls touch girls, but it's just not sexual. Many young gals (especially) can be seen holding hands while walking down the road. Add to that the schoolgirl uniform and you have a formula for stimulation for most Western guys. You get used to it, though.  I really wonder about some of these Korean guys, though.  urlLink The Face Shop  has a model on all of their (make-up) stores that's pretty gay looking. There are others as well. These guys are (I hope) more  urlLink metrosexual  than homosexual, although the distinction is greying. Many of the boy bands have similar dudes in them-the clothes, the hair, the dance moves. I got to really wonder sometimes. (Remember  urlLink this guy? )  Perhaps because of the stigma attached to being gay in Korea most gays don't come out of the closet--choosing instead to marry, have kids and be a 'normal' person or going into singing or acting or modeling and making the excuse that they're too busy with their career to find a wife. Either way, it's quite different from in the West where there is more acceptance of such things.  On another topic: yesterday I had lunch with my CEO/boss and he mentioned that China and Korea were having a  urlLink tiff about the Gorguyeo Dynasty . He said, 'oh, how can you know about that...it is just Korean history'. Well, when I said that is was about 50AD-600AD and was concurrent with the Paekche and Shilla empires and before the United Shilla dynasty that preceded the closely-named Koryo Dynasty of about 1100-1300AD that was right before the venerated Chosun Dynasty of 1392-1910 he just looked at me. Not sure if he got all of what I said, but a colleague dining with us said that I do, in fact, know about Korean history...hey, I've been here almost 2 years-and not all of it has been in the bars. My dates of Koryo are a little off, but if you want more information of where Korea came from take a look at  urlLink this site . It has a cool timeline...just right if you're writing a report! So, if you're speaking with a Korean don't be surprised if they assume that since you're a foreigner you  can't  know precisely anything about Korea--and if you do know some facts or stories from its history you can really impress them well here.  Oh, and just for the record:  I'm not gay.          "

Our teacher gives us a topic to write about. We get a generally short time limit to write as much as we can about this topic keeping it as legible as we can. In this “Quick Write” the topic was My Best Friend. We were to describe our best friend, or if you didn’t have one, you could write about what your best friend would be like. That was my circumstance.  My best friend would be a great person, perfect in my eyes. He’d be easy to talk to. He’d always listen and He’d be great at giving advice. I wouldn’t be afraid to tell Him my deepest, darkest secrets; I’d know He would keep them. He would not be judgmental. My best friend would never ask why I am the way I am, or why I do the things I do; He would already know. He would be extremely intelligent. I would never have to explain myself to Him; He’d simply accept everything. He would never be bitter at me for my wrong doings, but would always praise me for the things I do right. He’d be the only one with an unconditional love for me. He would never play favorites; He’d treat everyone as equals. Above all, my best friend would be a Christian, a healthy Christian who was very close to God. He’d be my best friend.  It was not until when I read it aloud to my mother when I noticed I chose my best friend to be male. I couldn’t explain why.

Never have, never will. For you are wearing a mask… a thousand masks. And you never really change; you just remove one mask knowing another is beneath it. Yourself is your biggest, most well kept secret of all times. The only time you can ever reveal your secret is in you dreams. In your dreams all your masks are stripped from you. You see how you truly are. But when you awake, you forget your dreams, yourself, your hidden identity. You put on your thousand masks, so just incase one falls off you can never be seen. And you step into a world of masked people. You step into a masked world.                "

Not only physically, but mentally too. It seeps deeper, opening every wound in you not yet completely healed. The knives penetrate through your entire body and sloe. All pain, physical and mental, becomes one thing. One ever-lasting thing. The process to heal such a great wound could take more than a lifetime. Death seems so relieving right now. But then you just freeze. You are iced. You can’t think, but thoughts are racing through your mind. You can’t speak, but you have so much to say. You can’t move, but you just can’t stay still. You don’t feel. Nothing seems real. You slip into a conscious coma. A stage of literal nothingness, with a numb pain.                "

My response is usually, “Life’s not fair.” One night after a completely “unfair” day, I thought about it. I thought about how you could explain life’s not fair. I decided to take a religious stand on this subject. I came up with this:  If life was supposed to be fair, we’d all go to hell. Do you think it’s fair that the most PERFECT man, who never sinned in his entire life, was tortured and killed for OUR sins and wrongdoings? But if life was fair, Jesus would not have died for us, therefore, we would not be saved. We would not have a chance to go to Heaven. So yes, life’s not fair, but it was never meant to be.                "

Do you be an optimist and lie to yourself: tell yourself it will be great and easy, only to let yourself down time and time again? I don’t.

We don’t know when our decease will take place, or where for that matter, or what is after death, although there are many opinions. Everybody is different, so I can only speak for myself, but death to me is in fact daunting. I’m not really frightened of how I die, it doesn’t matter that much to me. I’m not apprehensive about what happens to me after death, I believe my God will take me to heaven. I’m afraid of when I will die. I’m afraid that when I die, the people who I know would never have heard what I had to tell them, especially my family. I’m afraid that I’d pass before I told them I loved them so much. I couldn’t imagine their lives after I died without having a clear conscience that I loved them. I’d think they would think of my last memory of them trying to remember if it was a positive memory. Nobody wants to be remembered pessimistically. I want them all to know that I appreciate them all so much and I love them with all my heart.                "

I can’t even begin to explain the rush I get from dancing. I get so lightheaded. I don’t care what other people think. I don’t care what I look like, or what I’m doing. I become so incredibly care free. I am never free from stress anymore. I’m constantly working, and am always stressed out. I can never get a break! But when I’m dancing, I stop thinking. Everything lifts from my shoulders. I can move freely. There is absolutely nothing on my mind when I’m dancing, and I get light headed and dizzy. When I need to escape, I turn on the radio and wait for a good song to come on. Then I dance until I can hardly move anymore. Everything is forced from me.

When you say, “I don’t know how to act in this situation”, they always say, “Just be yourself”. But what if “yourself”, I mean the way you truly are when no one is watching, it not what they wanted or expected. You are constantly rejected for “yourself”. How would anybody attain friends or a significant other?  Certainly not by being you. So according to the surrounding people, be it at home, at church, with your friends, you put on an act to satisfy their wants in a person. Like a chameleon, you change your colors, attitudes, style, personality, completely change yourself to match and blend in to your surroundings. So when people say, “Just be yourself,” think about it.

As I was walking to my next class, with my arms crossed, I saw them again. This time they were hugging. Again I look at myself to see that I was in fact hugging nobody but myself. I really shouldn’t feel so alone, but for some unknown reason I do. It is painful, being alone and all. But I know there’s someone out there for me too. Actually, I KNEW there was someone out there for me, until I met my love. I finally found him. There is nobody that could compare to him.

And everyone is spitting their venom at each other in hopes of impressing the public with their 'tact'. Um..what. Instead of pointing your greedy little fingers and accusing Mr So and So, why don't you do one better, and tell us what YOU'RE going to do for us. Im sick of hearing what he did, how badly they did it, or how they didnt but should have. Says YOU. I guess it isnt like anyone is bound to believe anything you white collared putzs have to say anywya. You always do the opposite. I've been trying to educate myself on the different political platforms to figure out which I can identify with most. Personally, for some, I think lying would gather more votes. Shit, no wonder the libertarians never make it into office. To blatantly state    'We should eliminate the entire social welfare system. This includes eliminating AFDC, food stamps, subsidized housing, and all the rest. Individuals who are unable to fully support themselves and their families through the job market must, once again, learn to rely on supportive family, church, community, or private charity to bridge the gap.' ...is a ballsy move.  Oh? You thought that was it? Theres more:  'The bulk of your welfare tax dollars goes to pay the handsome salaries of well-educated welfare workers. The poor get little from government welfare except meager handouts and a cycle of despair.' Again...ummmm, what? So, let me get this right....government should stop paying the 'meager handouts' to families in need, and instead have those families go begging churches and charities for even smaller handouts..because...those 'meager' handouts are causing the moneywell to go dry? But hey, it's ok to throw cash at foreign countries and help THEIR people out. Who cares that most of them deteste the United States, and somewhere in their hearts pray for our annihilation. I bet those little bastards setting our flag on fire and stomping all over it after 9/11, aren't aware that our money covered their birth. Nothing better than paying for the future of terrorism.  Maybe i'm taking this personally, as I should. Because without the ever so popular 'welfare system'. My mother and myself might have suffered. Blah. I can see you all thinking that your precious greens have in some way helped me become the fine young woman I am today. BZZZZZZZT. Think again. The sum of monies my mother received could be accounted for with taxes paid out from my immediate family alone. She could have been on welfare for another 20 years, and technically, taxes paid by my extended families would have covered it. So i'll just thank them, and give you the middle finger for being arrogant enough to think that you have had any impact on my families financial prosperity. And now the shoe is on the other foot, or however it goes, and my taxes are paying for your sisters-mothers-best-friends-brother-nieces illegitimate kids. And to ease your silent curiousity, my mother is now a very successful businesswoman. So suck my tampon string.  Here is another Liberal issue, surely the cure to the nations healtcare AND war on drugs. Let's just legalise it!!! It's typical of the liberal party to promote the legalisation of drugs isn't it. I mean, for their stance on issues alone, they have to be smoking or snorting something. The liberals take on anything seems to be 'We can't control it so lets just legalise it and save ourselves the time and money it would take to correct it.' If you see it that way, you're a plain idiot. Does rehabiliation not cost money? Do damages not cost money? Ok, give some kid easy access to some pot, so they can fall asleep at the wheel and crash into a building. Or kill someone. 'Drugs should be legal. Individuals have the right to decide for themselves what to put in their bodies, so long as they take responsibility for their actions.' Ok, well when these users are irresponsible and their actions endanger other people, .. THEN WHAT? Let me guess, have their parents bear the responsibility. Riiight.  'Addicts out of control were a tiny minority.' Um...So was obesity. See how thats change. And food IS legal!  I can almost picture it...1972, after a demonstration on public sex, and the art of smoking pot through your girlfriends vagina, a group of teenage dropouts were arrested and spent a night in jail where they concocted this notion that if everything were legalised, the standard of their living would be improved and fuck consequences of drug induced peoples, fuck work performance, fuck cost of consequences, fuck everyone else. And the liberal party was formed.                     "

4030905,female,17,Student,Aries,"29,July,2004","                 Nuts. As usual, Theo and I played with food. Today's creation consisted of USA waffle, ice cream, hershey's choc syrup, QOO Lemon, ice kachang, maple syrup, chilli sauce, butter, tomato ketchup. So interesting. We did something worse after that. Theo poured the solution into Roy's drink can. Crap.   During lesson, we were still crapping. Making fun of HoFM. Theo imitated her la..trying to be funny. TBCM was worse. Only the other half of the class (the rest of the girls) were paying attention and doing their work seriously. The rest of us were gave stupid answers all the time. Theo was drawing throughout. The thing is, we were seated right in front of the teacher's table. First row somemore. hahaha...   After sch, Lim,Wilson,Theo and I went to IKEA. Lim wanted to go there to buy toys, for dunno what reason. We went there for hot dog first. Cheap and nice. Theo and I shared one cos both of us scared fat. Then we played with all the sauce. Custard,chilli and tomato. This time the mixture was nice..so smooth..hahaha...went to walk after that. hee..Then after that Wilson suddenly appeared behind us. But nvm...   Went to TM with Theo and Wilson&nbsp;after that. Kept laughing on the mrt. Theo kept imitaing and making fun of HoFM n GeokEng..wahaha..Wilson went to arcade to play while waiting for his friend. Theo and I went to walk. Then we went NTUC. After that I went home and he went to Orchard.   Tml still can play with food. cos we got one and half hr break. so good!         "
4030905,female,17,Student,Aries,"28,July,2004","                 Met up with Lim,Wilson,Roy and Theo for breakfast at Mac. I insisted want to go Mac cos wanted to play with food. So disgusting lor..Theo and I played with all the sauce. Mix honey,butter,sugar,coffee-mate,tomato ketchup,chilli sauce,coffee,milo and tartar sauce together. Fun but just gotta bear with the smell on our fingers after that. So fun to play with food. 17 years old already still play..so childish rite? The worst thing is that Theo blow bubble into the disgusting mixture using straw. yucks..eww..  After school, Roy,Lim,Wilson,me,Keith,Nicholas,Addison and Valerie went to Sakae at HarbourFront. Addison's treat.We had buffet. Total cost was $143.80. Too bad Theo didn't want to come along at the last minute, otherwise, we can really play with food.  Lim was perfectly normal today, which is quite unusual. She'd been nuts(to the power of infinity) for the past two days.  Giggles is very alert despite her age. Her lecture was damn boring that Theo and I started to write messages BUT she noticed us. Haiz..but one thing.&nbsp; The teachers din bother to stop us from eating sweets in class.It's against the rule to eat in class..but who cares, rite? Rules are meant to be broken(quote Mandy)..

Hmm..leftover food..wonder what happened to them? Theo and I played with the leftover food..mixing everything together till it smelled horrid..but was real fun. Jerren took a pic of the disgusting creation, Lim can't be bothered..too disgusted. The state of the leftover food is gonna be worse tml. lolx...crappy plans..depends..see where we go first. Basically, leftover food will NEVER be in good state when tampered with CREATIVE people like me..haha          "

Now he so ai mei..wear contacts..haha..but I'm still FAT as I always am. very funny..Lim and I laughed when we saw his pic..  Oh ya! Our NOODLE family was formed today. All thanks to Wilson. He's already so skinny yet he wants to go to slimming centre. Cos of his size, Lim called him noodle.  Then Theo named the rest of us. Jerren:bee hoon, Wilson:mee sua, Theo:mee hoon kuay, Steph Yap:yu mian, Steph Lim:ee mian, Roy:meepok..He named the remaining girls fishball, fishcake, tau gay, tau kua, tau pok and cockel..wahahaha! Our TBCM teacher was called ban mian cos of her hair..Very mean rite? But nvm..  Basically, we're crapping the whole day. See the TBCM teacher already can laugh. But Theo kept making me laugh during DBMS. Observe the teacher's eyes and the way she speaks, then IMITATE! not his fault la..we gotta have eye contact with the teacher when lessons are going on..*Theo imitates the way she pops her eye* (pop_your_eye.enabled = True) haha.. ;p  Lim's damn hyper today. Kept on talking and making noise non-stop, since the time we met in the morning till the end of school..still can't stop. uh oh...something's wrong. She accidentally caused Wilson to drop Jerren's hp on the floor till it was dismantled into a million partitions. But miraculously, the hp din go bonkers!  It's such  a fun day (except for DBMS prac. I lost my Country table..haha..)

TBCM can be considered the best tutorial..cos the teacher is easy to get along with and we can do all sorts of funny things like locking her outta class and using her account to logon to happy tree friends..wahahaha~the next subject that i like is CRS..cos there's no maths and practical required..our first homework for CRS was to watch Spiderman 2..can u believe it??

4030905,female,17,Student,Aries,"02,August,2004","                 Today we had bible study after school. Quite boring as had a long day. Everything was boring except DBMS prac. Priscilla asked a question in the bible study material: How do you confess your sin?  I was very sleepy and bored, so an answer came to my mind. And of course, I shared my answer. See ah..to confess sin.  Step 1: Commit a sin. Without a sin, how can you ever confess?? Step 2: Do some reflection about the sin. Step 3: Confess and you shall be forgiven.  Common sense answer right? No sin, how to confess? So must commit a sin in order to confess. haha..nonsense la.  I was very satisfied with my meals today. Didn't eat breakfast. Had one energy bar, two packet of watermelon, one packet of honeydew for lunch. And of course, sweets during lesson time. As usual. For dinner, I had one packet of hello panda, one kiwi and one green apple.  Hope to lose more weight. No pain no loss.       "

Practise piano, eat, sleep, study..so boring rite? Actually got morning call..but I was too sleepy. Cos I didn't want to sleep yesterday, even though I was really really tired. Haven't been sleeping enough. But nvm..I got ways to keep myself awake just to sit through boring lectures. Half a can of coffee every morning before class starts will do the trick. So boring.

Well, my job (I work as a Quality Assurance Tester) isn't that great, and they've been laying people off left and right at my job. I just found out today that this one guy got the axe a few weeks ago, but was told that his last day will be sometime in OCTOBER!!! Can you imagine being told that you aren't an asset to the corporation but that they want to hold on to you for two more months? I couldn't imagine it myself.   Aside from that everything with my boyfriend and I aren't going that well. He just seems to never really hear me. He's always so defensive and he never wants to be wrong. He can say somethng that he doesn't like about me, but then when I say the littlest negative thing about him he's all defensive and saying 'oh why do you switch it and make me look like i'm the bad person?' Come on give me a break. I've seen him 5 times in the last three weeks, but he see's nothing wrong with that. I mean people that live in different states see there loved one more then I see mines.  And then to add fuel to the fire I found out that I'm the victim of credit card fraud. I can't believe the asshole only left me with $20 on my credit card! Thank God I have others, and thank God I don't have to pay for what I didn't use.  Then my girlfriend, whom I've known since High School, is having a baby so me, and two of her childhood friends along with her brother are throwing her a shower. Well, at least we thought that we were. My girlfriend sent us information about what she would like for her party, but one of the girls is taking matters into her own hands. She replied to my friends message telling her that she need to mention anything because WE have it covered. Then she sends out the so called 'Party Committee' an email, and here are some excerpt from it:  1.) Theme:  'Red. her favorite color and because it's a boy she and I decided the shower has a red theme. She just told me in an email red and white and now she is looking for yellow but since i am in charge of decorations, I fell confident we can stick to our original color theme. Id we have to use an additional color that's cool, no one shohuld break their necks but white on red NOT red on white, which is totally diffferent. '  I mean seriousl, I don't thin that the whole 'Red Theme' is suitable for a baby shower. I agree more with the yellow. There will be kids there as well, so I just think that it should be somethng that would appeal both to adult and children. It is a baby shower for crying out loud.  2.) 'We will have red theme drinks and decoration. no cartoon prints like Blues Clues, Disney, etc. for example, She likes this giraffe that is yellow with red spots (he id not famous, she just seen it somewhere). This baby shower has more of a sophisticated dinner party feel as opposesd to a traditional baby shower feel. We will have red roses as the center pieces instead of one of those baby shower things.   ARE YOU KIDDING ME? A SOPHISTICATED DINNER PARTY, we have to serve the people appetizers on trays. Am i playing servent for the night or what? Can i sit and enjoy the day with my friend? I don't understand why you want a dinner party instead of a baby shower and on top of that there's not DJ! We (the Party Commiteess that is) has to make a mix CD each!  I mean why have a party committee if one person is making all the decisions?  Well, on a better note, i'm sooo excited about this coming weekend. My girlfriends and I are going to Six flags. I haven't been out there since I was about 12, which has been to long.      "

(bugger)  &nbsp; still, the idea of patterns and order is one that i feel is worth exploring. it is my contention that we understand things simply because we recognise the patterns involved. this generally comes from experience - learning to 'see' by interpreting repeating patterns of light as 'objects', for example - and so when faced with the unrecognisable we want to understand the logic of the pattern. if we are able to recognise familiar patterns in everything then we understand everything, but only&nbsp;in terms of what we already knew. if we strive to form and learn new patterns with every new experience then we understand everything, but with nothing in relation to anything else. the true skill then is to recognise both the familiar and the familiar in anything new:  what of this have i felt before? what of this have i never felt before?  &nbsp; i am rambling. i shall leave you with a list, and then be off to play solitaire.  staples in my stapler: 1 pictures of alex on my wall: 2 pieces my sunglasses are currently in: 4 pills left: 5 pictures of dido visible from where i am sat: 7 balloons on my desk: 12  n.

(these&nbsp;will be dismissed in turn, but to illustrate the idea i've&nbsp;started it as simple as possible)  imagine there are people waiting for the bus at every stop. one bus travelling the route will stop at every stop to pick people up, and take a certain amount of time to do the run.   this is obvious; but more interesting is if there are two buses travelling next to each other. assuming i) to be valid (as is the case on my way to/from work), people will signal for the first bus, which will stop. assuming ii) to be valid, the second bus will not stop and will overtake the first. the buses have now swapped positions, and will 'leapfrog' each other down the route, stopping at  every other  stop and thus&nbsp;completing the run&nbsp;faster.  however, buses tend not to set off together; it makes no business sense. but, if iii) is valid then there will be a statistical variation on the number of people waiting for the bus at any stop at any time. in truth, the variation is not truly random but follows a certain pattern (rush hour, etc) with  an amount  of variation built-in. and if there is a variation, then we can say that v) is not valid.&nbsp;so; if we are to imagine there is, at a certain stop at a certain time, significantly more people than the mean number of people at any stop at any time(which is statistically very likely) then the solitary bus will be signalled and will have a long stop for everyone to board. this will delay that particular bus, and the next bus along the route will gain some time on it. a feedback loop is created: the first bus is taking longer to do the run since its stops are longer, this leads to a greater build-up of people at the following stops and will cause  those  stops to be longer also. the second bus may not encounter the same heavy numbers of passengers, and so will gain on the first bus, moreso as the first bus is continuing to make longer and longer stops. eventually, the second bus will catch up, and the two will begin to leapfrog.  &nbsp; so we have leapfrogging buses; if these are running faster than a single bus would, then it is conceivable, is it not, that the two would eventually catch up with any single bus ahead on the same route? bingo! three buses in a row.  assumption iv) need not be discussed heavily since people will either simply signal the first bus that comes along (which is statistically more likely to be a 'first' bus of a pre-leapfrogging pair), thus not affecting the leapfrogging behaviour,&nbsp;or will have a ticket for a certain bus&nbsp;company, which modifies the idea from being 'any bus' to 'buses of a certain company', treating each company separately.  whilst assumption ii) is not valid in the general case, it does not affect the behaviour  in the long run . also required is the possibility of there being no people waiting at the stop; all the possibilities of first bus/second bus stopping are thus:  yes/yes: no distance/order change between buses yes/no : decrease in distance between buses, possible leapfrogging no/yes: increase in distance between buses, no leapfrogging no/no:&nbsp;&nbsp;no distance/order change between buses  if all these occur randomly then their overall effect is that described earlier, to promote leapfrogging.  &nbsp;  and there we have it; my idea as to why (particularly at peak times where it is more likely that there are people at each stop) buses can bunch up in twos and threes. i have no idea if this has been postulated anywhere else; i certainly haven't looked for it. but do let me know what you think, or if i don't make sense somewhere, which is quite likely.  anyhow, i'm making chop suey. excuse me.  n.

(hairdressers, not the marines...)   and then, of course, we do the quitenessentially british thing of remarking 'oh, yes, that's fine, thank you' when asked if the cut is alright. and then: we *pay* them, when we would rather stab them in the eye with a fork. grrrr.   is it a thing with hairdressers that given their job is to cut hair, they just keep going well past the point they should stop? when i get my hair cut i indicate how much i would like taken off, and then they generally confirm by doing the hair-through-the-fingers thing. i become optimistic; they have obviously understood. so then they cut the right amount off all over my head, and i am content. and then, for no reason that i can gather other than perhaps making more work for themselves, they *do it all again*. and again.   i cannot adequately describe how genuinely depressed i get after going to the hairdressers. i sit there as they cut, and with every snip i can't help but think 'well, there goes another four weeks dedicated hair-growing'. and then i leave, and my neck gets cold. i hate it so much.   when i graduated, i paid a lot of money for a 'special graduation haircut', my attempt at ensuring looking nice for posterity. i went to town (literally, not figuratively, although i suppose the phrase came from somewhere). i made an appointment. i paid double the price i would normally expect.  i hated it. i could have saved the extra money; i could have bought a pizza. sheesh.   even talking about it makes me sad and angry. maybe i should refuse to pay. maybe i should start out by explaining exactly what i want, and letting them know i intend not to pay if they cut my hair too short. they always cut my hair too short. maybe i should stop them half way through.  i knew i should have cut it myself. i knew it i knew it i knew it.   i hate the hairdressers. i really do.

3705830,male,25,Non-Profit,Cancer,"16,August,2004","       i have cracked spider solitaire. last week i came up with a method of defeating it, and i haven't lost a game since. some are taking a long time and are decidely tricky, but i've completed every single one. now, everyone knows i normally only do the medium difficulty one, but today i tried a game on the hard setting. i completed it. convinced?  i guess the first thing to note is that unlike conventional solitaire,  every frame can be beaten . an obvious statement, perhaps, but important, i think. i developed the idea on the two-suit variety, and i haven't done it rigorously, but i hope you'll get the idea. general principles, then.   i) always keep a spare cell when you can. this is the most useful space since anything can be put there. always work to be making a new spare cell; the more the better.  ii) keep a track on colour (or suit) changes; the less, the better. always use a spare cell to swap out matching suits if you can. before a new row fill the spare cells to give lesser numbers of changes in the board.  iii) clean runs of the same suit can be treated as a single card; runs of different suits are therefore broken down into that many single cards.  iv) if you have many of one card value, then try to keep them exposed as little as possible by not moving non-running cards on top of them.  v) using two free spaces, simple runs of different suits can be moved using the  urlLink tower of hanoi  principle.  vi) completing a suit and removing it can never be a bad thing since it does not alter the ratio of unmatched 'useful' and 'unuseful' cards.  vii) stacking up suit-changing runs isn't a bad thing; it helps to free spare cells which are more useful in the end. it is common (on the medium setting) to be able to complete two suits before needing the first new row using this idea.   but, most importantly, and the key to the whole issue, is that  you have to remove the element of chance  from the game. if you rely on luck, there is a good chance you will be beaten. if you want to beat the game every time you have to sacrifice the honour of playing an honest game.

'this never happens in my room!' he says, mock-seriously. i feel no compulsion to explain the decidedly less exciting truth of the matter; i just smile and leave the illusion. that's showbiz.  n.

'oh yes', he said.  let me tell you now, he is a lying swine.  so now i have no immediate way of loading my mouse driver. purely rational has no floppy drive ( it is a laptop of the  future , and besides i couldn't be bothered to pay for an extrenal drive). my old laptop  does  have a floppy drive, but it doesn't have a cd burner. nor does it have a modem or network plug. or usb ports. (it is a laptop of the  past , and besides, it was free). in fact, of their 26 assorted ports and things, there is  no way whatsoever  that i can make the two machines talk to each other in the way i would like without buying some extra (read: 'expensive') hardware. shocking. anyway, i've arranged for it to be done now. but ergh, it annoys me. i might write a snotty letter to dixons (no link because they are evil evil lying swine, although they offer cordless optical mice at affordable prices) and hope they send me  urlLink something cool .   new cd: welcome interstate managers, by fountains of wayne. very good.   stopping by the supermarket on the way home to spend a fortune (£14) on my continued survival, it is interesting to note the hastily-erected shelving selling umbrellas. in august? sheesh. i pick up some essentials (bread, milk), some healthy things (oranges, tomatoes), and some random bits (stir-fry sauce, biscuits). i have recently taken to swiss-style meusli, that is to say meusli with raisins, nuts, and no extreme political views.  i resent paying over  urlLink 50p  for a loaf of bread; sure it tastes nicer but seeing as i never get through a loaf fast enough to avoid throwing the last three or four slices away (as i did this morning). i am now trying 'stays fresher longer' bread, 44p. i have high hopes; except i have doubt about the grammar. shouldn't it be 'stays  fresh  longer', or just 'stays fresher'? or am i too worried about my bread?   the last thing to mention today is the post office; and some interesting distinctions in the british postal service. i am sending a friend a cd, and i am enclosing a brief letter with it. if i send it as a 'small package', it is cheaper than sending it letter-rate. imagine you are sending someone a book; if you send it on its own it is a small package and can be sent (relatively) cheaply. if, however, you enclose a 'letter' with it, then as far as the post office is concerned the  entire weight  of the parcel is your letter, and you are charged accordingly. but what constitutes a 'letter'? for the small package rate you are allowed to enclose a brief letter which references only the item you are sending. so, if you write 'dear jeff, here is the copy of  three men in a boat  i promised, hope you enjoy it' then no problem. but write 'dear jeff, here is the copy of  three men in a boat  i promised, hope you enjoy it. little malcolm fell off his bike yesterday...' then pow! you have just (according to the postal service) written a comic novel. so if they ask you if there's a letter inside when you're at the counter, you know what to say. and you too can make sure you're sending things as cheaply as possible, even if it does mean you have to write (as i do) 'small package' on everything you send...   nmrboy's currently favoured dinner: pasta (enough for 2, cooked) cheese (small cubes of) cooked ham (diced) tomato (1, raw, chopped) olive oil ( extra  virgin, whatever that means) basil (not a siberian hamster)  all mixed round together, serve hot and frequently. food = good; or at least its the most similar word you can form with a standard 'qwerty' keyboard. coincidence? well, probably...  n.

A few comments here and there online only to find that JAIME WON!!! UGHHHH!!! NOOOOOOO!!!! For gawd sakes do we NOT have enough female pop-TARTS out there these days?? Yes her looks will sell her to the male audiences even if she can't sing. I think we needed someone like Mario to give all those male singers a run for their pec and chin implants. Rosa well....yeah the worst singer but she didn't have the spark and she can't shake it like J-Lo and Aguilera. Jo-Jo was just too sweet I think, or too simple....I dunno one or the other. Apparently it works for a woman but not for a man. Yay Jaime you have just become a part of the machine that is stardom,but for the love of all that is sacred someone give her cue cards so she can stop writing lyrics on her hands!!!  Cheers!      "

All the advances in health care and medicine have people who might not have otherwise survived living till their 80's and 90's. A couple thousand years ago 30 really was middle age and 60 was as old as 90 is today. Always searching for the youth, the secret of eternal life....dealing with a whole other area of medicine that will become the focus of all our healthcare dollars even more so...'Geriatrics' I love my lil grandma dearly but it is so hard to watch her age, she was born in 1918 the year Influenza B swept across North America and killed so many. Indeed her own mother became very ill when my grandma was only a few months old. Grandma was sent to stay with Aunt Lizzie till her Ma was better. She managed to stay well through that. She also managed to survive as one of the middle children in a family of 9 kids. In a house with no running water. I think about how my child will never know what it's like to have to live with an outhouse and baths in the kitchen(well those ones in the sink when she was 6 months old were cute hehe). My grandma married a man 12 years her senior whom was the love of her life....brought 4 kids into this world on Dairy Farms. Worked hard..watched her family grow...watched my grandfather grow more and more ill after he retired and take care of him like a nurse after his many strokes. He passed away in 1988 and she has never even considered another man. Then her energy was directed back to her kids and grandkids, and most importantly her garden. That woman has more strength and courage than most of the people I know. And as I watch her health start to fail at the age of almost 86...I find myself dealing with the one of the hard truths of life. We all will die one day. So I am not sure if I am more upset at the fact she will not be here forever...or the fact that I won't. I need coffee...Cheers!      "

I treated myself today to some dresses, I felt so gross the last week. I realized I had only one really 'pretty' dress..I am a girl I guess I can act like one once in a while instead of feeling like I have to be some plain non descript blending into the crowd figure. I'd like to be able to look in the mirror and say 'Daaaamn I look GOOD!' and really think it. For all my bravado about not caring what other people think about my looks...I need to be less critical about what I think of them. I know the really good stuff is on the inside, I know how to love, I know how to care, I know how to make others feel appreciated...But I live in a culture that has ingrained into my being this myth about beauty. I did some reading a few nights about about body image and older civilizations...dammit if I lived in the time of Reuben...I'd be a SuperModel...lol. We are taught young to find fault with ourselves...our lack of looking like that less than 1% of women who actually do model. I still find it so bizarre they use women we can never be instead of the women we are to sell us things. There would be something self satisfying to see more women just like us model...or models chosen on the basis of their deeds...cause in the end it's how good you WERE not how good you LOOKED.   &nbsp;  I had more to say but I got distracted, so yeah then I guess I am done for now.

Too bad it never found it's way to anyone who appreciated it though lol.  If Time was a River  If time was a river that flowed to the sea And love was the vessel that would carry me I'd pack it with patience with laughter with care with passion and friendship and take some to spare If time was a river that flowed to the sea And love was the vessel that would carry me I'd need someone steadfast to be on my crew And if I had get to choose, I plan to choose you   Ok that's not exactly the original but not bad if I do say so myself. I should dig up my old poems and get them on the blog...might be good for trip down my dark and twisted memory lane.  I was actually missing work today, but know I am not ready to go back just yet. A couple more weeks and I should feel better able to face the world head on again. It's been nice to just kind of see where the day takes me, but then I think about all those people I am not getting to help. I sometimes shake my head at the apathy so many of my co-workers have...then again so many people in the world are apathetic. When I get to hear 'wow thank you soooo much why has no one ever taken that time to explain this to me?' or 'You are a dear you took all my worries away' at least I know for the few minutes that person talked to me they felt like someone, somewhere cared about who they were and what they needed. Someone told me I had too much to give one time, isn't that what it's about though?? You give of yourself to the right people...and they give back to you...not rocket science yannow? Or give the right things to the right people. I almost wonder if it takes a stronger person to accept that you deserve to be given back to...instead of feeling like you constantly are going to 'owe' something to someone.   Cheers!      "

We all live with perceptions...about ourselves, others, the world..spend a lot of time classifying the same. In the pursuit of all things wonderful we forget the wonder in what we already have. Nothing is sweeter than realizing that old adage...it's not having what you want...it's wanting what you have.  I'm taking time for me for a change, and it is not an easy thing. I am so used to being many things to many people. But what I keep getting told is that if I don't take care of me first my efforts are pretty much wasted. Funny after 33 years to be told my expectations of myself are too high...when I have thought I just wasn't trying hard enough. Ah if only...if only what I don't know...but...ahhh if only.  I love finding the beauty and art in everything...the way the sun shines through the leaves on my apple tree just so. The brilliant diamond sparkles as it dances across the water in the pool. The flowing motion of the ripples across the pool as a giggling child spins around as fast as she can in the water. And her laughter...I still think it's one of the best things I have ever and will ever hear. Right up there with hearing her sweet voice first thing in the morning reminding me I am loved. It's been far too long since the depth of my love for her has moved me to tears...and here I sit reminding myself that she is the reason I need to be whole and happy.   Take that extra minute to find the beauty in your day, that one small reason no matter what it might be...remind yourself it doesn't all have to be stress and hurry. Cause this ride around the sun will be as brief as the ones before and the cosmos needs your spark of light to be full of everything that made you smile.  Cheers      "

'When an old woman like myself blushes, it is a very bad sign. Ah! Lord Henry, I wish you would tell me how to become young again.' He thought for a moment. 'Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days, Duchess?' he asked, looking at her across the table. 'A great many, I fear,' she cried. 'Then commit them over again,' he said gravely. 'To get back one's youth, one has merely to repeat one's follies.' 'A delightful theory!' she exclaimed. 'I must put it into practice.' 'A dangerous theory!' came from Sir Thomas's tight lips. Lady Agatha shook her head, but could not help being amused. Mr. Erskine listened. 'Yes,' he continued, 'that is one of the great secrets of life. Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes.' A laugh ran round the table.~~  The only thing one regrets is one's mistakes... Interesting theory. I'm not sure that I agree with that... Maybe, to some degree... But the OTHER theory... To get back one's youth one had merely to repeat one's follies... That is very true... So many people tell me that I look and act so much younger than I am, but the acting young is what promotes the looking young... Other people my age think that now that they are a 'certain age' they have to act a 'certain way'... That is what makes people old... old is an attitude, not an age...

Anyway, he has contacted me again... It is so wonderful seeing his messages, knowing he is still thinking about me, even if his life gets too complicated to call or email me at times... Maybe I will go to be with him soon, that would be wonderful...Someday, I hope to be with him all the time... But until then, I will take what I can get...         "

Someone needs to tell them that the world does not end at the county line. We are citizens of the world, not just of Hick County.  Around here, music means classic rock or country. Period. (Nothing wrong with either... I listen to those too...) I listen to Gothic, punk,&nbsp;alternative, jazz, R&amp;B, soul, classical, techno, industrial, you name it... Anything but polka...LOL I have friends around the world, (online) and from all religions and races. If most of the people here knew I had friends that were Pagan, or wiccan, or heaven forbid Agnostic, I would probably be burned at the stake.  I get so tired of know-it-all people who never think outside the box... I love art, and poetry, and good literature... I crave intelligent conversation, on literature, philosophy, religion... I want to be able to buy really good clothes without driving 250 miles... (I HATE Wal-Mart!) I long for coffee shops, with real cappuchino, not the powdered kind that sputters out of a machine like bad hot cocoa... A book store with a good selection, a music store that actually has the music I want (Cooper Temple Clause is an unheard of group in this God-forsaken place!!) I want to get my nose pierced without losing my job. (Yes, I was told I can't work where I work with my nose pierced!)  My house is probably the only one for miles that is decorated in modern furniture and artwork... (95% of all homes here are done in 'cutsey' country... )  All women are expected to be sweet little things, quiet, 'respectful'... that isn't me either! I am tough, intelligent, and that scares most rednecks...  What am I still doing here??  I wanted my son to go to a small school. Not one with rampant drugs, and teen pregnancies, and security guards...  I suppose this is a small price to pay for my son, but I will be 49 years old when he is 18...

Well, for lack of a better term, were 'fuck buddies' when I was in high school. He was with another woman, but while she was busy at the counter, he came back and talked to me...Flirting, hinting at things that we had done 'back then', and asked for my phone number and email... And I gave it to him!  I know for a fact that he is not interested in what I am looking for... I want a real relationship, I want someone that respects me, cares about me. He just wants someone to 'play' with... I KNOW THAT, so WHY did I not just say no??!?  When I married my husband, I loved him. But I also had, in the back of my mind, the thought that no one else would ever ask me to marry him, so I'd better say yes. That recording seems to be still playing in my head, as if I should feel grateful to any man who shows the least bit of attention to me. I know that is what I am doing, yet when the man is standing there I don't think about it... I don't say no... I simply grab onto the attention like a woman overboard grabbing a flotation device.&nbsp; I get so mad at myself sometimes... I seem to be scared to say no...  &nbsp; I have been doing the same thing with another man, Stuart. All he is looking for is a good time... But I tell him, oh yeah, I'll call....

Not a bad thing in and of itself, BUT he has a girlfriend. A pretty permanent one.  Why do I always fall for the ones I can't have? Girlfriends, wives...

I'm completely serious. Those who've kept up to date with my family drama knows what she's like, but it's like she gets more disrespectful towards my parents, me, whomever, every day. And the fact that my folks continually put up with her sh** astounds me. KICK HER OUT OF THE GOD DAMN HOUSE!! I'm sorry, she no longer has gas money to get to/from work until her next payday because she's giving it to her deadbeat, no job, I-scam-my-own-kid-because-I'm-too-lazy-to-work boyfriend. Make her walk to work Dad, take the bus, whatever. MAKE HER GROW UP!! Stop bailing her out, literally, figuratively, you name it. Just stop. Stop cosigning her bankruptcy papers, stop interrupting your day to bring her lunch, stop letting her order beer with dinner after two DUI's, stop allowing her jackass boyfriend over without backing your threats to call the cops on him. STOP ENABLING HER! I'm beyond angry at her now-- there's no point anymore. She is and will probably always be a me-me-me person, and the way she treats my parents, she can frankly go to hell at this point. But the fact that my parents keep taking it over and over, saying that they're finally going to draw the line and enforce rules but then get lazy about following up with it, I'm about ready to distance myself from all of them. If your own lives, household, health, or sanity isn't worth fighting for, nothing I can try to say anymore is going to change your minds. You pretend to listen, but apparently I'm the only one who feels your existence is worth it. Kick her out, for the love of god, and let her finally live with the consequences of her dumbass decisions. She's freakin 24; she'll learn to deal.  My God!

In an attempt to do so, however, we discovered the true meaning of hell on earth as we know it. This hell is otherwise known as U Village. You may be familiar with it, what with its trendy, overpriced department stores and coffee shops, orange-fleshed patrons pushing the pedals of their graduation-gift Lexuses with their pristine Ugg boots. Hell. We honestly could not understand what about this place made seemingly normal people such twits. Parents suddenly flinging their toddlers into the street because they, after all,  do  have the right of way. Stay at home moms in trendy Touregs blocking entire lanes in the parking lot so that they could selfishly have that next available spot, no matter how long the line behind her was. HELL!    It all connects to a bigger picture to me, the things that rank high on my pet peeve list. It's why I hate leaving home on weekends. The chaos, the carelessness, the selfish people who think it's all about them in this world. It's making me already dread the approaching holiday season, for the love of God! I hope people don't mind more internet shopping this year; I fear that with my lowering tolerance and increasing road rage that my braking foot might fail at a very inopportune time for you, dear affluent family with your triple-seated stroller walking down the very center of the road without any regard of my approaching bumper right on your Tevas. Come now, would it really be such a shame to have one less of you out there? I thought not.           "

For those who do learn of my existence here, expect nothing earth-shattering or mind-blowing. You should know by now that I am a quiet one, not as politically savvy as the men-folk in my life, opinionated still but just choose to keep it to myself more often than not. So here goes, some inner thoughts.  I just read some of Foutsy's previous postings, and I have to say it, he's an outright liar.  When referring to the 4th's fireworks display, he states that he's 'just not as impressed with big flashy things.'  And yet not a single other person could outjump him or squeal louder than his shrill soprano voice could at Tim's bachelor party.  All of the other men had fallen silent at the sight of the groom-to-be's scrotal bling, but not the Fouts.  It was blinding and it was magnificent.  I like boobs. Most of you do too, admit it. They're one of the only true bonuses of gaining a few extra pounds, and I love it. They're squishy, they bounce just so, they help fill out an outfit just a bit more, they draw (sometimes flattering, other times creepy) stares, they're fun.  Picture two octopi rubberbanded together, and poke.   Neato.  Last night the kids and I went to a local eating establishment and met Tim's new coworker, Gina.  Sweet girl, funny, outgoing, cute for a borderline midget.  I, however, hope that we can use young Gina to get to her acquaintance with a most unfortunate name.

He muttered a silent blessing to Khaine as the fog begun to shroud the land. He and the few other scouts have lost their way among the fog, if he does not bring this message to Aldamir, the rest of the army would be in peril. Adamantios pointed ahead as a tide of darkness swarmed over the path ahead. Lysandros nodded as they rode into the trees, which provide ample cover for them. There was an order to keep silent and any communication was to be passed by hand signals. The chitterling horde marched forward, ranks and ranks of units were tightly packed together.   “I hate this damn whether!” Quikchitter bared his teeth. Quikwarp who stood proudly.   beside him nearly squirted the musk of fear as he tried to push it back.   He was honored to be invited by the Grey seer to ride upon the Cauldron of thousand poxes. As the cauldron went it releases terrifying screams and laughter, which would even send chill down the spin of a dragon. Quikchitter pondered about where will be their next destination, the arrogant Quikwarp was almost too proud he should have let him walked with the rest of the army. “ Quikwarp I have an important task for you.”   “What is your wish? Most potent of potentates,” He replied boldly as he swings his tail around excitedly.   “I need you to go down and check to see if the ratling guns are working well, recently there seems to be some minor malfunction,” Quikchitter spoke rapidly spurting saliva into the cauldron of thousand poxes. Only to be responded by hideous hissing sound.  His ears lowered and lost his enthusiasm as he heard the bad news. He muttered silent cures to the Grey seer and half hopingly that he hadn’t heard it. He made his way down the filthy corpses as he pinched his nose, he wondered how could the Grey seer have stand to all these perhaps he have a spell which could remove this repugnant smell. It was all too possible; the selfish Grey seer would not impart his arcane arts to anyone. As he walked towards his own company of clan Skyre rats, he thought he had smelled something. Among the smell of furs and rats, he smelled something unusual as he tried sniffing harder. “Elves!”  He curse the day that he had been born, the foul rats have spotted them. If they were to ride out from here they would be swarmed by hundreds of rats. There would be no chances of survival. If they were to abandon their horses here they would not make it in time to deliver the message. But sacrifices were needed to be made. He signaled one of men and whispered into his ears. His face betrayed incomprehension but swiftly nodded and proceeds to task.   The Grey seer stood upon the surveying his army as pride swelled within him. He attempts a grasp at the winds of magic. Gathering a small globe of energy in his hands, he blasted a slave pulling the cauldron. The rat expanded and contracted his eyes were red and was swelling to a point of bursting. Poxes and symptoms of diseases appeared on his skin. And soon the rat exploded leaving only a pile of bones producing putrid smells. “Faster, faster, quick, quick!” The Grey seer snarled as he lashed out with his whip. Suddenly, bells were rung and he knew they were being attack. Anger and rage boil within him as he wondered who dared an intrusion into his army. The frenzied monks broke of the ranks and gave chased towards their enemy. Shouting war cries and froth and phlegm’s dripped from their mouth. Quikchitter quickly cast a spell of vision, and so he could see clearly what was disturbing their flanks. The vision shifted in and out, blurring images and palpable ones. The spell stabled as he could see a horse running away from his army. “Stupid fools, its only a horse,” he spoke softly under his breath. A green light glowed madly on his fingers, sending the shadows dancing like a mad caper on the ground. He incanted the ancient words of his ancestors and unleashed a streak of green lighting towards the escaping horse. Reducing it into a pile of dust. The blood frenzied monks gave up as they saw there was nothing to kill and hurried back to bolster the ranks of the army.       A boyish smile appeared on his face as he savors the victory. “ Well done men.” Lysandros spoke softly but just enough for the elves to hear.          "
3429420,male,15,Student,Aquarius,"23,May,2004","       The young elf ducked as a blade shimmered past, at the same time lashing out and hamstringing his brutish foe. The orc gave a deafening roar and fell to the ground like a huge tree shaking the ground. The thin elf stepped aside nimbly, avoiding the collapsing bulk. Drawing his dagger, he bent down and delivered the killing blow.  The champion looked up from the dead body and saw that his comrades weren’t doing so well. Many of them had fallen before the orcish onslaught. He knew any moment from now would mean life and death. He raced with elegant steps across the slaughter ground avoiding the corpses on the ground.   “To me!” Mansuetus commanded as he raises his sword high so everyone could see. Within minutes the elves formed a circle around him raising their spears high threatening anyone who comes within a metre length. He surveyed his disciplined soldiers proudly. The well-trained elves did not fail him. A few orcs made a daring attempt trying to carve its way through but only ended but with spears through his torso. “ Hold! Elves and you would live. Expect no quarters, for you would give them none!” The leader bellowed and every elf shouted in a single tone.” Hundred of orcs surrounded them waiting for a hole the defenses. A few orcs again made daring attempts but soon ended up dead. It seems the orcs weren’t as patient, Mansuetus thought as a smirk appeared on his face. “ On my command, you would send this brutes to wherever they came from!” He shouted a command in the ancient language to the crossbowmen. The crossbowmen loaded their crossbow and nodded in understanding.  Finally the orcs patient was at an end, the green skins roared and shouted war cries in their primitive language. “Now!” the champion signaled and spears was leveled to the eye and sound of crossbows unleashing death. This was what he savored every moment as the orcs lumbered into the wall of spikes. Steel met steel, blood splattered everywhere and sound of screams and shouts filled the air. “ Fight on my elves and fight well for this day you will replenish the blood within your armors!” Mansuetus charged in fray of combat, slashing and hacking as he went. An orc twice the shoulder length of him and was the largest orc he had ever seen. The massive orc bawled a challenge, and was quickly answered.   Through the visor he stare into the eye of his foe trying to anticipate his every move. The orc wield his axe menacingly and gave an evil laughter. “Fle’ be fo  ma, da wil‘ na de fet ma.” His voice boomed loudly as he made his unstoppable assault. Mansuetus parried with every ounce of strength and speed he could muster. Strands of hair flew as he avoided the humongous axe only by an inche. He saw an opening and made a riposte attack only to see his blade bouncing harmlessly off the orc tough hide. What would appear a grin appeared on the orc ugly face. Beads of perspiration dripped down his delicate face. He was panting heavily and he felt he could not hold off the assault anymore. His bones ache like a rusty mechanism. His green skin foe seems to be tireless only to be laughing and fighting. Fear gripped him like a vice.  Darkness descended. His eyes were wide opened, he groaned in pain. Blood streamed down from his open wound. Every strands of strength was sapped away from him, he could no longer feel his legs, and his limbs were drained. He dropped his axe and crashed into the ground. Mansuetus took moments to realize that a shadowy figure was at the standing at the back of the orc general. He wanted to laugh at the moment but could not. From the shadows came a calmed voice, “Thou have done well Mansuetus, champion of fifth regiment of the Shadow Warriors.” Only to realized he was the assassin, whom his general had spoken well of Mansuetues made a courtly bow and said, “ I thank thee for thine compliment for if thou wouldst have saved me, and I wouldst have fallen to these cursed orcs.”  “The battle is over, assemble the elves and have them report back to the camp immediately,” he spoke softly.  Mansuetus nodded and said, “Yes, my lord.”        Mansuetus walked into his simple house, he took off his armour and took his scabbard and hang it by the side. “Mansuetus! You are finally home I was so worried about you.” Mliara said excitedly as tears swelled in her eyes. She was a beautiful woman, with striking features and fine figure. She ran over to embrace him, and kissed him deeply. Fatigue of the battle and heat of love conflict, and he spoke softly, “I missed you greatly, but I am tired now I wish to rest.” He gave a reassuring smile and wiped the tears softly away from her face. “I have prepared your clothing and when you have finish bathing, we can have a good feast tonight.” He took up his fresh clothing and walked over to the river.   He could see the clear water flowing gushing down the endless river. The wind blew softly and the leaves rustled. He stripped off his bloodstained tunic and entered the refreshing water. He rested on the rocks by the riverbank and enjoys the peaceful and soothing ambience. Life was too perfect for a moment he had a caring and lovely wife and recently he was promoted to captain of his regiment. The extra income would provide a better life for his wife and he himself. He opened his eyes lazily not knowing for how long he had slept. Suddenly sound of splashing water made him jumped to his feet. He quickly put on the robes his wife had sewn for him and with drew the dagger in his boots. He sneaked among the bushes, his natural talents made him moving like a cat, among the bushes. He crouched down and to his horror he saw bands of men dressed in barbaric helms and leather clothing wading through the river.   He quickly made his way back to his house and put on his battle equipment. He and his wife quickly made their way out of the house. Every second lost would mean life and death. They ran as fast as their legs could carry them. Suddenly shouts could be heard. Mansuetus heart raced, as he knew the enemy had spotted them. Mliara tripped on a piece of rock and fell, blood was spotted on her knees. “Mliara!” shouted the battle-trained warrior.   “I can..not…..go on any fur..ther, Mansuetus you must…carry on!” she slurred as tears burst forth from her.   “My love I cannot go on without you, if we must die we must die together.” He ran back and carries her on the back. “You cannot run fast enough if you would carry me, they would soon catch up with us.” Perspiration streamed down his face, muscles tensed as he ran with all his might. Sound of his pursuers came closer and closer; he knew with every step they make they would be one more step towards the city. The chaos men were coming closer and closer. He fought on against the endless tide. What would have seemed forever, he thought ended with a loud thud sound. Droplets of blood glittering in the sun spurted forth. Grief and sorrow overwhelmed him. He stopped and slowly put her down by the side of a tree. An arrow protruded through her chest. “I’m sorry my loved one,” she said drawing all the energy within her. Her eyes closed and he knew she was dead. He gripped his sword and there was a glint of madness in his eyes. Blood course through his veins. He invoked the name of Khaine and turned around to face the chaos worshippers. A muscular man held a bow in his hand and smiled, happy that he had shot the target but soon his smile was gone as he head rolled off to the ground.   Mansuetus, captain of fifth regiment of the Shadow Warriors fought with frenzy and hatred. He was cutting left and right beheading anyone who come within the tip of his blade. The chaos worshippers soon learn to fear him, they surrounded him and no one dared to attempt an attack. He glared menacingly at his foes, if it was as if just a look of his eyes to even cause fear in the heart of a stout dwarf. He swings his blade in a sinister way. Light danced off from his blood-forged armour, the runes on his sleeves glowed brightly. Instead of waiting he lunged forward skewering the groin and hamstringing another. More chaos men formed up around him. Only rage and sorrow were gushing through him. In his eyes he knew no fear. Regardless of his own life he charged into the tide. Hacking and slashing and hewed a path though the chaos men. But slowly he was overwhelmed no matter how fast he could dodge or strike he was unable to. The chaos men swarmed down on him and held him tightly. He roared in rage and bit his teeth into his tongue the sweet taste of blood filled his mouth. Veins were bulging up as he struggled frantically.   A group of elves charged into the fray and it was all too much for the chaos worshippers. They turned and fled ignoring leaving their weapons on the ground. Mansuetus lay on the ground filled with cuts and bruises. A huge scar was evidently marked on his armour only missing his flesh only by a few inche. His eyes were vacant; he felt life has no meaning with the death of his wife. “We spotted this band after a few peasants had sounded the alarm. We apologies for the late arrival.” The leader’s words contained sympathy and fear. He ordered two of his men to aid him to stand. Their faced betrayed irritation as they tried to push it back. Mansuetus staggered across to his wife and knelt beside her. Tears swelled in his eyes, as he buried his head in his wife hair. “ Please wake up my love, I beg of you.”           "

I have been spending my time most often in Npcc, but many things have past that worthed my attention and pondering.   The Angel Well over my days i must say, i have valued and tried to learn as much as possible. I read the book, Woman can't read maps and men just can't listen. Haha, strange choice ehh? It made me understand the difference between men and woman and why such difference exist, and what we can do to prevent pressing the red button. Now i move on to a new book written by a famous and good writer, R.A Salvatore who wrote many good series. I have only managed to the first book among the hundreds.    Other than that, it has been most satisfying to win another battle against the odds. Perhaps i have played too long and the expierance have been instilled upon me or perhaps my opponent needed more time.  Another attributes which i have gained over the days was being able to control myself over problems and everything. Being composed in difficult or tough situations is a most useful skill. I have to thank warhammer for that...haha  The devil  There are always evil thoughts which sprouted in my youthful mind. Sometimes it pays to heed its call but i must not be misled. Now i realise more that firends are the essential ladder steps to climb to the top. But perhaps it is nothng more than a evil thought. Still it makes sense, other than simple ladder steps friends provide companionship and someone to talk to. Now i must try to get rid of it.Begone creature of hell!  The dark  Since from last week, my good cousin or rather my best friend had left for army. I miss his companionship and a listener for my sorrows and joys, and nevertheless some good laughters.Still i cant change anything it is beyong my capability to prevent it. Though I was glad that he was positive about it instead of frowning.   Npcc has took up most of my time, spending my time sitting on iron steel chairs and listening to chants. Much time is wasted, a good thing is i can practice my body language reading. Managed to read a few but still i'm not very good at it.  The shooting competition was of my msot regret in this past ten days? Yes it was the most regretful thing. I didnt expect that i have enough time, so i didnt aim for the shooting competition. I have only managed to score a score of 93 which was fairly poor although i pass. I didnt try my best was the worst mistake i have commited!Now i truly wish for a time machine.           "

A big problems I have with making games is my lark of a real artist. I gave up on my Rolling Thunder(tm) style game because it was really hard to stay excited about a bunch of odd chapes moving around on the screen.  I want to make an adverture type game with swords and stuff, but that's probably because I've had Zelda on the brain recently. I wonder if the Zelda games are named specifically after Zelda Fitzgerald...I guess I'll never know.  I like top down shooters, maybe I'll make another one of those. Earth Defender B was kinda lame, though it still ranks as my only game with sound effects.   For the people reading what kind of 2D game would you like to see, maybe a puzzle game?

The final wasn't that hard except for one problem that I didn't do because I didn't even know where to start. The only class I'm worried about is Linear Algebra, or as it should be called 'Hard ass shit that I'll never remember and barely understand in the first place'. Man, I thought Calc 2 was tough. I'll take problems dealing with the surface area of graphs rotated into 3-space any day over these problems.   I really hope I get a C or B in this class. If I did worse on the final than I though then I could get a D. If that happens then this semester is a total waste. I need so many more math classes than anything else that to not pass one puts off my graduation by one more semester. The fact that I can't take any math classes this summer semester is, for me, a total travisty. Add to that the fact that I can't take ANY classes this summer and I'm pretty bummed about that. I was hoping to at least be able to take another yoga class or a programming class, or an art class. But no, nothing fits my work schedual.   I feel like I should want to party because I'm done with school for a little while but I really don't. As much as I can't stand individual people I like to be around people in general and school is a great way to do this. Now I'll have nothing to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays. I guess I could look for another job for the summer, but that would be lame too. OHH SHIT!! I got it, I can try being a dealer at a casino,I've always wanted to do that. Man that would be so sweet, I would be standing there and be all like 'Sir would you like to hit or stand...' and he would say 'Hit me' and I would give him another card and then I would probably say 'Ohh Sorry sir, I guess you shouldn't have hit' and then I'll take his money.

Every person sees things through their own perspective and with their own thoughts coloring what they see. You would think that with all this uniqueness of thought and perspective going around there would be many different personalities and a real sense of individualism to go with it, but there's not. For as far as people have gone group affiliation still seems to be a driving force in society. It's like once we stopped living in tribes and towns got too large for everyone to know everyone else we had to create tribes of our own, and in order for these tribes to have meaning and consistency in our large society each member of these neo-tribes must conform to an even stricter set of guidelines than would be necessary in an average tribal society.   It's funny how every group seems to think that they are unique and that they are true individuals, however most members of a group almost always dress the same, or at least very similarly. I swear to god that if I see one more of those 'You laugh at me because I am different, I laugh at you because you're all the same' shirts I'm going to barf all over the person wearing it and them that I'm laughing at them because they think they're 'different' while wearing a shirt that could have it's own wearers convention I've seen so many people wearing it.   Every person has the capacity to have so many interests it's not funny, sometimes I think I bore people to death talking about my own, but I've noticed that many people never seem to have any real interests. It's almost like people are afraid of being kicked out of their neo-tribe if they express an interest in something that none of the others like. Each group has it's own safe area it could be literature, music, clothes, style, whatever, and you will often hear people talking about those things, but not so much about other things.   I think it's important to note that I'm not talking about friends, there is a difference between a group like the neo-tribe that I'm talking about, and a group of friends. It's also important to note that my friends kick ass and that I'm not talking about any of them.  However, I am talking about many people I do to school with at DVC. It's strange to walk around campus and hear people talking about the dumbest most meaningless shit. It's even stranger to try to talk with people and try to talk about meaningful things, not like the meaning of life or anything just about things that actually interest people (what they plan to do after school, where they grew up, hobbies...), and have them get all uncomfortable and leave. I don't know if people think I'm hitting on them or what but almost every time I talk to someone like an adult with full comprehension abilities rather than talk to them like they are children (how are you? I like your hat? the sky is nice...) they end up looking at me like I'm nuts.  The other end of that spectrum are people that try to talk about the craziest thing they can to prove how different they are. Somehow these people annoy me even more than people that talk about nothing because it just seems that they are forcing something that isn't there. It would be as if I talked about the goatse man with everyone I met.           "

If my readers will remember I have been in trouble with my boss for not doing a good job and coming in late and basically being a bad horrible person. Well imagine my surprise when I came to work today to find a 'Spirit Award' sitting on my desk. These are given out to employees that capture the spirit of the hospital workplace and go above and beyond what is expected of them. Do they know who they gave it to? The best part is that it can be handed out by any manager and I got one from my bosses boss. This doesn't change my work situation at all, but man was I surprised.          "
3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"22,June,2004","       I've been working on my new game for a little while now it's coming along okay. I have a lot of good ideas and am starting to flush them out before actually setting about writing them into code. Recently I've been working on implementing a 2D SDL based particle engine. I've had a few problems because unless I use single pixels for particles I can't figure out how to color them. So I would have to have different particles drawn in each color I would want , or have all particles be the same color. It's so much easier to do in OpenGL. Half the game effects I have planned are particle effects so if I can't figure out how to do them in SDL I may have to do the partiels in OpenGL, I know there is a way to use OpenGL with an SDL window, I just han't read up on how yet.   Right now I'm working on this game less than any others I have worked on in the past. By this point in time on my missile command clone I had already finished an OpenGl particle engine and setup all the particle effects I would use in that game. My lack of work is mostly because I spend more time playing pool than doing almost anything else, aside from sleeping and 'working'.   I need a laptop that can boot and get on my network in about 5 seconds, that way I could just transfer to my laptop and take it with me everywhere. But it's too much work shuffeling code around all the time, and wanting to go out but having to wait for the laptop top boot and then copy over the files. If the USB on my home computer actually worked I guess I could just use a thumb drive to move things around. But alas it does not work. ASUS makes some great boards, but this one isn't exactly the greatest. Maybe I should buy a new motherboard and processor and shuffel this one to my windows system. Hmmmm....my birthday is coming and a nice new ASUS board with a gig of RAM would look mighty fine under the tree. With a nice P4, ohh man, that would be so sweet. The only thing sweeter would be a dual processor board with TWO nice P4s nad TWO gigs of RAM and maybe a 10 gig solid state hard drive.   Well, time to go play some pool I guess.  At least I did write a few lines of code today.         "
3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"18,June,2004","       Yesterday was, all in all, a pretty good day. Even if certain people that needed certain rides to work from certain hospitals didn't give me money for gas or the bridge. I took the oppratunity to go to lunch with my Mom since I was in the East Bay anyways and it's been a while since I've gone to lunch with her. I then went to Cody's Books in Berkeley and looked at (Surprise!) some books. I bought one. For the purpose of suspence I will not reveal what the book that I bought was untill a later date.   I went home, played some video games, and took a long nap. That nap ended up screwing me in the end. I woke up, went to Kinders and talked to a couple friends for about 5 minutes before heading off to a pool tournament. I ended up taking second place and wining a heafty sum of $35. Not too shabby considering that I got lucky in quite a few games. But that's just the way it goes, sometimes you get the bear and sometimes it gets you...I guess I got it last night, but it wont be long before it gets me back. What a jerk.   I ended the night be getting a sticky Sobe from Wolves and talking to Miss Macy for a little bit. I went home, played some more video games and went to bed to try to sleep, something which I failed miserably at. It's now the morning of today and I got about one or two hours of sleep. I guess the bear did get me back...while I was in bed, he is a jerk!         "
3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"15,June,2004","       Well, today is my last day of forced vacation from work and I'm kinda glad to go back because the heat is killing me. I wanted to do more with the past week then just hand out like normal. But It's hard to find people that want to get out and do stuff early in the day, especially when you're not so sure you want to yourself. Is it getting hotter!!! It's 4:00pm, I figured it would start cooling off but my house defies me again and shows it self for the oven that it is. Roasted griffenjam is on the menu tonight.   I got the new Zelda game, Four Swords Adventures, last week. It came with a free shirt and I'm wearing it now, for the third time this week, I did wash it yesterday though so that is no excuse to stay away  from me. The game is alot like the new Harry Potter movie. It's really good for what it is, but don't try to compare it to anything else in the series (or in the movies case the book) because it just wont live up. In practice it's very much like Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. Which was the worst Final Fantasy game ever. The thing I hat...dislike the most is that you cant just walk around the world at your leisure. You have to select a specific are to go to, then select an available section, and clear it to move on to the next area. I don't like games that are too controlling, let me do my own thing dammit.   A Link to the Past kicks this games ass so hard the bruises may never go away, but like I said, it's fun for what it is.    My, and Isabella's, birthday is coming up soon. I'm wondering if my dad will call, I doubt he will but I hope he does. It's normally pretty easy to milk an absent parent for good gifts or cash, as long as they feel bad about being absent. However I didn't even get a card for Christmas so I think that I may be out of luck. I wonder what the etiquette is with crappy dads when it comes to the rest of the family. My Grandmother, his mom, is having everyone at her house for her birthday soon and I was invited. I want to go, but I don't know. I always get the feeling that I'm a little set apart from them, except for Grandma.   For example, I'm the only liberal in a very conservative family, I'm also the only non-baptized one. I also know that if I go I'll just get even more mad at my dad than I already am. Like last time I went up. Some cousins and I were playing softball and then one of them said something about playing softball with my dad recently. This was funny because my dad lives in Arizona and she doesn't. That means that my dad came to California and at some point played softball with her (something he hasn't done with me) and never even called me. Before that day I thought it was the entire family that he ignored but during that trip I found out that it was just me. Everyone kept asking me about what I thought about things he's been up to or have happened to him. All of it was news to me. Ohh well, what can I do, but if he thinks he's getting my liver or any other organ someday he can think again.           "
3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"11,June,2004","       I don't want to make a habit of posting news stories but  this  is one I felt I just had to share. It would seem that in the year 2003, the second full year of our all out war on terrorism, the amount of terrorism used in the world actually increased. They tried to lie about it and say that the level of terrorism had dropped lower than it has been in 34 years, but someone called them on it and now they look pretty dumb.   This is exactly what I have been saying will happen. A war on terrorism will only increase the number of people that are willing to use it to acheive their aims.          "
3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"09,June,2004","       Okay. So, in my last post I said I had a meeting with my boss that I thought was going to be bad. It was. Due to my non-stop lateness and over the top internet useage I've been suspended for two days. While I think that suspension was a little harsh I could use a little time off. The only thing that bugs me is that I'm not the only one in my department that does this stuff. I'm just the most obvious one. Hell one person plays flash games all day. Another gets off the phone from yelling at his wife just long enough to call someone regaurding his after hours work. Ohh well, I guess that's what it means to be low man on the totem pole.   Enough about that, now it's time to tell about me being hasseled by the man. The other night I was driving home from playing some pool and I see a cop driving around, I say to Isabella, 'He's going to pull me over'. Low and behold he does. I wasn't doing anything wrong, nothing at all. He tell me that the computer says that my registration is expired. Just to make it totally clear, I had registred my car a week previous and considering that the police had a connection to the DMV computers right in their car I find it hard to believe that my registration is showing up as expired. He eventually lets me go.  Last night, just two nights after the first incident, after leaving a pool tournament (which I didn't win) I see a cop, and he sees me walking to my car. He pulls around in a parking lot and waits for a few seconds watching me, then he leaves and goes up the street out of sight. He's out of sight for all of five seconds and I see his front end creep around the corner watching me start my car and let it warm up for a minute. The second I drive off he's on my ass. I  LOVE  it when cops tailgate me! So I try to be carefull not to do anything stupid but in the end I kinda do. I'm at a red light and and I see a car coming but it looks far enough away that I think I can safely turn right. The cop didn't agree. He pulled me over and asked for my license. This piqued my interest because he didn't ask for my registration. I would have thought that if my registration was showing up as expired he would have said something about it, but even after checking the computer and coming back with my license he didn't ask for it. He just told me to yeild next time and let me go.   God I love the cops in Benicia. I live in Vallejo and drive around that city all the time, at all hours but never get pulled over there. I go one town over and it happens quite often.          "
3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"09,June,2004","       I have a meeting with my boss in about 10 minutes. I always hate meeting with authority figures. I have a feeling that this will be bad. It's a follow up to a meeting I had previously with her when we discussed how late I always am, I've been late alot lately. In my defense I've been sick lately and it's harder to get up and around early when you're sick. I don't know how to tell her that without sounding like I'm just making excuses, which is something I really don't want to do. I guess it doesn't matter really. This place isn't known for handing out raises so it's not like I'm going to miss a chance at a raise because I'm a bad employee, and I don't think I'm quite fireable yet. Though that would really suck. I'd hate to have to turn to selling my body to pay rent.         "
3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"06,June,2004","       It's funny how much time can change you without you realizing it. When I was 17 I had the world figured out; I was the person I really wanted to be and couldn't imagine ever wanting to change. I was going race people on the feeway with my VW Bug for the rest of my life. I was going to do other things too, but I was sure that racing my bug was going to be a big part of my life forever. Well, two accudent later I no longer had a bug to race and it's really hard to look like a straigt up hardcore pimp driving a Bonneville (and it was so easy in a VW Bug!).   Now that I have a car that can race I find that I never actually want to do it. Maybe I'm just afraid that I'll get in a wreck and die, I mean how fast could I really go in a VW Bug?    Heh, actually it's funny for how much one changes, how much of them stays the same. I remember when I was young, maybe in third grade, I used to be afraid that when I grew older I would turn into someone else. That somehow the voice inside my head would be different and not connected to the one I had at that time. I was afraid of being older, like 15 or 16, I didn't know how to do it then. It all seemed very scarey. I would be expected to do things and know things about the world. Like how to pay taxes and register cars. I would be expected to know how to SPELL!!! Well, I guess I can't get everything right. When I made it to 15 the last thing I wanted was to be 18. There were breif moments when I wanted the freedom that being 18 would bring but those moments didn't last long. I didn't have a large college fund, $1000 doesn't even go far at community college, and I knew that none of my parents would be kicking down the many thousands that it would take to send me to school. I also knew that my grades weren't good enough to merrit and kind of scholership worth talking about. This all ment that I would have to work for a living when I turned 18 (which actually turned out to be when I was 16) and even thought I hadn't done it yet I knew one thing anout work, it was for suckers. Ten jobs later I have only confirmed that, work really is for suckers.   I know that a blog is supposed to be like a diary. A log of events in your life, but I find my typical day to be too mundane to talk about. I don't mean to diminish the importance I place on hanging out with my friends thought. I saw a few of my friends yesterday and last night and I really enjoy it every time I'm around my friends. Whether it's going to the mall and getting a bit to eat or sitting around shooting pool and trying to win stuffen animals the time I spend with my friends is the most important time in my life. That is something that has never changed about me and I hope that it never does.         "
3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"06,June,2004","       I just got back from see the new Harry Potter movie and I guess I'll say some words about it. I wont try to spoil anything but if your looking to be surprised then dont read this post (like anyone reads these posts anyways).   Overall I thought the movie was good for what it was however it pays the book absolutely no service at all. Some events are out of order, happen in entirely different places, or are completely missing. Unless it was after the credits the trainride home wasn't even in the movie and that means that pidwidgen (spelling?) wasn't either, sorry Ron I guess Errol will have to do for now.   Quiddich was completely forgotten about after the first match, which is too bad because I was really looking forward to seeing Harry's patronus run down Malfoy. Actually many things arn't in the movie at all, which I was expecting but it seems that too much is missing.   Time also seems to move very quickly. Before you know it it's christmas time, but strangely enough it never actually is christmas. It seems that opening presants on christmas is a feature of every book, but it didn't make it into the movie. Sorry guys, no sweaters from Mrs. Weasley or any  other preasents .   One thing I was sorry wasn't in the movie was the lack of normal interaction. You never really see the students in class unless there is a major event in that class. The books deal not only with the main story line but also with the life of Harry and his friends in school, this is something that is completely missing from the movie.   I still liked it none the less.         "
3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"04,June,2004","       All my life I've had lucid dreams, dreams which you can control, however when I have them it's fairly rare that I realize that I'm dreaming at the time. Ladt night is a perfect example. I had a dream that I was arrested for some reason and thrown into jail, this was a lucid dream, however it's hard to take control when you don't realize that you have any; I thought it was real. I was totally freaking out, wondering what the hell was happening. However it was that bad because every time I wanted anything I would find it right away. I was a little thirsty and instantly found a coke machine, I wanted something to do and found a rec-room filled with pool tables. I wanted something to eat and I just all of a sidden had food, I don't even know where it came from. After a little while it turned out that I was in the coolest jail ever. Somehow I missed that fact that there was a surprisingly small number guys in this jail and the majoiry of the population was filled with hot girls. How did I not reailze that I was dreaming.   I'm staying home from work today, my sickness I mentioned before has not gone away and I figure that if I have to deal with it for a while I may as well take a day of work. This sucks more than is immedatly apperent to anyone that doesn't work for communists. At the hospital I for at your sick time and your paid vacation all come out of the same bucket. The time I'm taking now is subtracting from my paid vacation time....that is so lame it makes me even sicker. It's actually a very bad policy to have in a hospital. I wonder how many people, in order to conserve vacation time, go to work sick....in a hospital...go to work sick...sick...to their work....their work which is where tons of people are that shouldn't be around anyone that is sick that they don't have to be. Ohh well, I don't make the rules, I just try my best to not follow them.   I saved some of the best news for last. Last night I won a pool tournament. Brought in a wooping $69. Woohoo! Actually I got quite lucky, and you can believe me when I say that because I think false modesty is one of the fakest things since McDonalds cheeseburgers. It really rips me up when I know that someone is trying to be modest and saying things I know they really don't think.  Well, I have to go, I told Isabella and MaterialGirl that I would come hang with them.  Don't do anything I wouldn't do....and if you do call me first so I can come and watch...         "

I couldn't sleep at all last night and when I did drift off for a short period of time I had a strange dream about  Optimus Prime and I hiding in a room on a space station that looked surprisingly like the pharmacy at the hospital I work in. It seemed that most of the Autobots were being mind controlled and they were looking for us. Optimus wasn't in high spirits and neither was I.   So, I'm tired and cranky and I have a sore throat and so when I got to work I decided to do what any sane person would do at work and try to plan my class schedual for next semester. This turned out to be the wrong thing to do on an already bad day. Budget cuts at school have now hit home for me. There is a greatly decreased number of Tuesday/Thursday classes and some of my favorite teachers arn't teaching the classes I need to take, which is okay because the classes arn't at time I can take them anyways.   Why is it patriotic to blindly support every war Bush takes us into but it's okay to let education funding slide. Wanna talk about patriotism, how about putting some stock in this countries future and educating people for a change. Our big bad weapons wont mean shit when others develop energy shields and were left behind because were a nation of dumbasses that don't care about funding education.   I was going to talk about a bunch of other stuff but I just got blindsided by my bad day. I need to talk to a counselor about what classes I can take for my major now that I can't take the math class I need or the programming class I need.          "
3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"27,July,2004","           Last sunday was the anniversary of the day of my birth. It's not a global holiday yet, but I'm working on it. I had a pretty good time. I had gone to Lake Tahoe with my parents, my sister and her husband. I won some money on the first night I was there, that was pretty cool. We went to Nevada and saw some sights, including the town that Bonanza was filmed in. Then we came back and went out on a dinner cruise in the lake. It was pretty cool. The food was alright except for the fact that no matter how anyone ordered the steak it came out medium well. But considering that it also came out within five minutes of ordering it I have an inkeling that it may have been already cooked and would have been hard to uncook it a little to make it med. rare.         The boat sports a small glass bottom that is too small to be of any use to anyone that isn't just trying to check on the color of the water under the boat.  But it was a nicvee trip altogether and I enjoyed the views of the lake. I took lots of pictures, as people normally do in that kind of setting, then in five years I'll probably do what countless others have done, I'll look at those pictures and wonder where the hell they were taken and what exactly I was taking a picture of, because aside from trees and water there is nothing remarkable in the pictures.         After we got back we all went gambling. The idea was to go together but we ended up going our seperate ways after long. I did well but wasn't making the millions I wanted to so I quit and walked to a pub that sports a pool table and figured I'd shoot a couple games. This was a great decision it turns out, because I met two very nice girls from Oakland in the pub. We shot a few games then decided to go gamble a little, but on the way to the casino stopped off at a club called the Cabo Yabo or something or other. Now, I don't drink, smoke, or have sex with everyone I meet so the clubs have never really been my thing but we were having a good time none-the-less. I turned 26 standing in that club. We stayed there for a little over an hour then went to do some gambling. I lost a little money ($6.50). And at 2:30am figured that it was time to go to bed. I bid my new friends farewell and left for the warm, if not lsightly stiff, embrace of my bed in my temporary home. I should have gotten their numbers but I didn't. Ohh well, maybe I'll see them again.          In the morning I went to a breakfast buffet with my family and had a pretty good breakfast. After that we gambled a little more, I lost thirty dollars. Then everyone left, one group at a time, with me leaving last. I came home ans went out with some friends to a local bar. Aparentally I spent the whole night muggin' (staring in a menacing way) people, or so I was told, repeatadly.            "
3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"23,July,2004","       For those that don't know, and since everyone that reads this knows me I'm talking to no one that's likely to see this, I play in a pool tournament every thursday night. Last week I did pretty bad, the word dismal comes to mind. Losing is one thing, but missing a bunch of easy shots is another. To put it plainly; I just plain sucked.  However this was a new week and my sucking seemed to have abated because I came out swinging this time and I was dropping fools like that's what they were made for.  Well, I guess I could remember it that way if I were drinking or doing some heavy drugs. In reality I got lucky in alot of games and owe many victories to the person I was playing choking or getting really lucky with a leave.  My luck ran out in the last two games. This is a double elimination tournament so that means everyone can lose twice and the winner of the winners bracket plays the winner of the losers bracket. This means that the last person in the winners brackets has to be beaten twice by the last person in the losers bracket, which is exactly what happened, with a little help from me. For me the only important shot in both those games was the last on of the second game.  The eight ball was sitting on the side pocket and I had a clear shot at it. I took carefull aim and hit with just a little right english to make sure that I didn't follow it into the side pocket and took my shot. I had hit to hard and the right english carried the cue ball right down the table and into the corner.  Ohh well, it happens. Sometimes I feel like the whole thing is a luck game anyways.  And that's all I have to say about that.           "
3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"22,July,2004","           So, today I did stupid shit like waking up and going to work and coming home and stuff, then I did something pretty cool. I went to see some bands play at Blakes in Berkeley.  I ended up going by myself which is cool with me, but stuff like this is always more fun with friends. Ohh well, at least no one I know saw me jogging down telegraph trying to find a place with a public bathroom I could take a crap in and not die from some disease five minutes later.         I got there rather early and the show started rather late, which ment that I did alot of standing around outside by myself before the show started. Yet again, I don't mind being alone. My dislike for humanity as a whole compells me to no talk to most other people and since I'm a pretty momentumy person my non-talkingness carries over to pretty much everyone, even people I might like to meet. However this doesn't stop crazy people from talking to me and telling me about how they think that Kurt Cobain was alot like Earnest Hemmingway because both blow their brains out. But figuring that you just have to take it as it comes I just smile and say something like 'Wow, I never saw it that way.'.         The bartender at blakes, the girl that works on the main level, has a very strange thing going on. I normally have a pretty good feeling about what people are like, what kind of person they are and so on, and this girl game me a really strange feeling, but in a good way, kind of like the Buddah or something. I wanted to ask her a bunch of questions and try to figure her out but I figured that some creapy guy in a green hat asking where she grew up and what her favorite color is might seem at best like I'm some creapy guy that is hitting on her, and at worst like some creapy loser that is wearing a strange hat and hitting on her.  She was also cute and smiled alot, I like people that smile at people they don't know, I do it all the time but rarely get one in return.         The first band that played was pretty good. There were from the East Coast and played something that sounded very much like L.A. ska. I don't remember their name though and I didn't care to get their CD I kinda had the feeling that they were jerks. This was confirmed when I saw them mocking the band that played after them, Sputter Doll. Sputter Doll played a great set, I really loved it. I felt kind of bad though because all the other bands were pretty much straight ska bands and here they were playing punk. I  got the feeling that most of the people there weren't really digging on them too much, which is too bad because they sounded great. I wanted to get their new CD but they packed up and left before the band after them finished their set. Which brings me to Warsaw. I got a Warsaw Cd back in '97 and thought they were pretty cool. I had no idea they were still around untill today. They played a great set with a bunch of original sounding ska, and even had someone playing a conch shell in one song. It was great to see all the people dancing and haveing a good time, I know I was. However I really had been hoping to hear some of the songs on the CD I have, but they only played recent stuff.  Ohh well. Like I said, gotta take it like it comes, no use complaining about it.        After they were done I left, I didn't really care to stick around for the next band. I drove to the Pastime to play a little pool. Which is exactly what I did, play a little pool; two games to be exact. Once I got there I realized that I was too tired to stay for long. I played and them came home, sucessfully getting out of Benicia without getting pulled over.              "
3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"12,July,2004","       Last night I was sitting on the can and had the thought that it might be a good idea to write about something that happened to me years ago, just over ten years ago in fact. It's about the first time I fell in love, or at least thought I did. I'll leave out many of the boring details because I'm told that they, rather than adding depth and interest, just make my stories long and drawn out. I was a youngster staying at a hotel/casino with a parent. This meant than while my parent was gambeling and doing whatever I didn't have shit to do. However I was a horny youngster so I went to hand out by the pool, I didn't have a swimsuit, but I figured that girls probably did. Well, while sitting by the pool I noticed a girl around my age, who actually turned out to be a couple years younger, sitting with her grandparents. She was very attractive in an offbeat sort of way; I couldn't really put my finger on it or figure out why I thought she was so attractive but you don't really questions those things too much do you, if you think someone is hot you don't really care why. Well, being a little wuss I knew that I wouldn't talk to her, especially no in front of her grandparents, so I didn't really think about it. Now, it becomes important to point out that I am, and always have been, a big ice eater. In my earlier years it wasn't uncommon for me to just get a cup full of ice and munch on that for a while, something that I did at exactly this point in my story. I got up and got a cup full of ice and sat back down. About five minutes after that the girl got up and got some ice as well, on her return trip to her seat she commented to me about how great the ice there was. This shocked the hell out of me because at that point, and to a certain degree to this day, I had the feeling that I was pretty much invisible and went unnoticed unless I walked into someone or something.   At that moment nothing more came of that. Her grandparents and her eventually got up and left, I had nothing to do so stayed there for a while. There was a view of the river nearby from the pool area, so I checked that out for a while. I eventually got bored and decided to walk around elsewhere. I left the pool area and hit the elevator button, which was right on the other side of the door from the pool area, when I heard someone say hi to me from behind. It was that girl, we talked for a little bit (untill the elevator got there). It turned out she was waiting for her grandparents. When the elevator arrived I really wished I could keep talking to her but I didn't know if I would look crazy if I called up an elevator and didn't get into it so I left. I kicked myself all the way to whereever I went after that.  I did something, ate dinner, blaa blaa for the next few hours untill it was almost time for bed. I told my parent that I wanted to go for a walk, which was true. I was told to be back by 10pm. I went back to the pool, mostly because I wanted to see the girl, but also because I enjoy being outside at night and looking at the stars, even to this day I can sit outside and look at the stars for hours and not get bored. When I got there I found that I was the only one there, I sat down and thought about things for a while, then a door opened and she came out. We talked for a couple hours about all sorts of stuff. I found out that she was from Seattle and her grandparents lived in Sacramento. I can't remember her name (I'm terrible with names) and for some reason it completely slipped my mind to try to get her address.  When midnight rolled around we both figured that we were probably in quite a bit of trouble for staying out so late and went back to our rooms. I was happy that I had met such a cool person but sad because I knew I would never see her again. I was actually depressed about this for a few days. I wrote in a journal at this time in my life and I'll repete here the advice I wrote in my journal.   If you take the time to get to know the perfect person, at least make sure to get her address.         "

I do it a little at a time, I'm not a very hardcore developer these days. Think I got this far with Earth Defender B within the first two or three days. But this game is going to be better developed and have a special quality that Earth Defender B didn't quite have, this game will be fun to play. Since I don't do much artistically that I can share with others I figure all I really have right now is my games so I'm going to post a screenshot so all can see my fledgeling game in all its glory. Before you start dissing my game, or me, remember this is still very early on and that I'm not an artist. Also the map isn't exactly laid out for looks right now.l..blaa...blaaa, here is the pic.            "
3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"08,July,2004","       Well, I'm trying to sign up for classes and I'm having some problems. It seems that thanks to budget cuts all the classes I want are at times I can't take them. I can accept this, for now. So I'm thinking that I will talk to a counselor and see what classes I need that are in times I can take them. So I call up and try to make an appointment. This was my big mistake. I expected a department in a college to do something that makes sense (give advice to students before a semester starts). I was told that for now they are only giving appointments to people that are already taking summer classes. So in other words they are only helping people that already have classes and don't really need help. I was told that I couldn't make an appointment until school actually started, and even then I can only make the appointment once school starts, it would be weeks before I could actually see one.   WTF!!! So they only counsel people that have already made mistakes. Hey, glad you made an appointment to come see me, ohh look at this,  you took all the wrong classes and wasted this semester, should have talked to someone before signing up for these, but now it's too late to even add classes because not many teachers will let you after the first week...  THIS MAKES NO SENSE!! Why only help people after it's too late for the help to do any good! Why are there no sections of Calculus III at a time when I can take them, not only at DVC but also at Contra Costa Community College, Solano college, and Napa College. Are there any others I can try?   And I'm tired of people that use its when they mean it's, if you want to say it is use IT'S DAMNIT!!! The same goes with your, and you're. And what's with Yellow Cabs anyways, so what if it's yellow, doesn't have to be in the damn name does it!         "
3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"06,July,2004","       I just read  this  and found it pretty sad. This kid wants to go kill Muslims. That's it, kill Muslims. God I hope they don't let him into any branch of the armed forces, just what we need, some kid with his own Muslim killing agenda. This is sad on so many levels it's not even funny.   Normally when someone gets mad at things like immigrants or people of other races it mostly fear that drives it. Normally fear that these people aren't actually inferior to them and can do things just as well as they can. How many times do you hear highly skilled people go on about immigrant problems...not alot, because they know they are secure in their job and aren't afraid that someone that isn't acclimated to the culture and can't speak the language well is going to come and take their job away. As far as I'm concerned if you can be replaced by someone that can't speak English and only just got here then you probably didn't deserve your job in the first place.   I also love how the same people that talk about wanting unfettered capitalism and a laissez faire government are also the same people that hate on the illegals. I'm sorry but you can't go on about the glory of the free market one minute then talk shit about people that are the living expression of it the next. Illegals work harder for less money than most of this country, they had to go through more shit just to get those jobs and they risk far more thanany of us ever will just by coming here in the first place. They embody free market capitalism, they risk everything for a shot at a better life, and they are willing to work hard for it. And because of them we have cheap fruits and vegetables. I don't hear anyone complaining about that, you never hear anyone say 'Damn those illegals, these oranges should cost 10 times this much!!!'.   The funny part of it is that we, as a country, support the illegals every day. If you buy fruit chances are an illegal picked it. Do you shop at Walmart? Guess who got busted for using a company that hires illegals.   Just like my answer to anything you don't like in our society, if you want to do something the only real way to make an impact is to boycott. If you don't like illegals then don't buy anything they pick, shop anywhere they clean, or pay them for anything. Personally I don't care about illegals, like I said, I know they aren't taking my job. And I'm pretty secure in knowing that most Americans are too lazy, stupid, and cheap to actually do anything effective about the illegal 'problem' so all they will keep doing is talking shit.   Another thing I love in this country is people thinking they are better than anyone else on Earth just because they are born here. I'm sorry, but this kid has no room to talk about what other people should do or about how they don't deserve to live here. I've got news for you kid, no one born deserves to live here, some of us are just lucky. And before you start acting like the popular kid keeping the nerds out of your party I have to ask you, what have you done to make this country great? People go on and on about how great this country is, and I don't disagree, this is a great country, but it's not through their actions that it's great. It's thanks to people like Thomas Edison, The Wright brothers, and, thought I REALLY hate to say it Henry Ford that this country is great. It has nothing to do with John Q. Asshole that does alot of talking but doesn't do shit worth talking about, every country has those. Until you do something worth talking about I don't really want to hear your views about who should be here and who shouldn't because for all we know the child of that fruit picker that came here illegally will invent something that will allow the U.S. to maintain it's dominance in the world. It always amazes me how a country of immigrants could have so much hatred for them.         "
3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"05,July,2004","       As the title suggests I had a great weekend, I'm just sorry that it had to end. I wont go into all the specifics but I hung out with bunches of friends and family and even saw La Plebe play at the Phoenix Theatre in Petaluma. I got to see my friend from the good ol' state of Oregon and her twins. I think of the twins, Charlotte, is starting to like me but Maggie still seems pretty wary of me.   I got to see two parades this year, Vallejo and Benicia's. I think I can say without too much hometown bias that Vallejo's was the better of the two, although both shared quite a few floats. I have a feeling that is the reason that Benicia has it's parade on the third, because if it did it on the fourth many of it's floats would be in Vallejo. Benicia's after parade festivies beat Vallejo's handsdown though. In Vallejo the Vallejo symphony plays after the parade and there is like a mini-crafts fair. In Benicia there is literally dancing in the street as a rock band plays various other bands hits. I saw no crafts booths, but there were a few food stands. There is one thing that Benicia is missing and that is a Ducky Durby. I know I bought a duck from a person in Vallejo's parade, thought I didn't go to the actual race. Maybe my duck won, that would kick so much ass. I would even love to get fourth place....hmmm, I don't know what happened to my duck ticket though, well they have my name and address.   Well, this was a great weekend and I'm glad that I got to spend it with family, old friends, new friends, and people that are just becoming friends. If every weekend were like this life would be grand and almost any lame ass job would be bearable because I would know that I had the weekend and great friends and family to look forward to.

Since I posted that screenshot I have added such wonderfull and awe inspireing things as bullets, and one enemy that doesn't have the ability to fire at you yet, which is okay because it's mostly just a flying bomb itself, it has been named a spin-drone. Mostly because it's a drone, and it spins, or it should. Right now it just looks like a tweeker robot thing that is makeing strange movements that don't really resemble spinning at all.   I am such a bad pixel artist it isn't even funny. Well, for other people it's funny, and I guess I do laugh sometimes at my own crappy art, so I guess I should say that i'm such a bad pixel artist that it's only occasionally funny, and most time the horrors oof my art are beyond humor. Maybe I'm going over the top a little, but I don't think so.   I'd post another screenshot but I'm lazy and no one would care so why bother. Plus the game isn't that visually different yet. I need to work on the HUD a little more and take all the debugging text of the screen, and add another enemy or two, then I'll post another screenie for you all to ignore.  BTW if anyone that may be reading this is a pixel artist and wants to have their name in the credits of this game post your e-mail addy and I'll get back to you.   A large chunk of the coding for this game is done, everything I have do has been done with the idea of code re-use in mind. All I have to do is add support for a few things and the buld of the game will be finished, so if an artist were to join up now if would be quick easy game credits to show their art in action. So, after all I'm really the one helping you out, not the other way around.         "
3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"06,August,2004","            So this week I took a break from doing absolutely nothing with my life to go to Linuxworld and try to waste my time getting cheap Linux related junk that will collect dust in my house. It was a great success. On Tuesday LoveLostLibra came with my and we made the rounds hitting up every booth we could, gaining information and looking for cheap crap like it were the holy grail. Some products I had a real interest in, Blackduck had a pretty cool app for programming teams, and others that I couldn't care less about, ahem...veritas..., but only talked to to get the cheap crap.   LLL and I had a pretty good time, I think (maybe he's really plotting to get back at me for boring him to tears for bringing to a Linux trade show, who knows), Intel threw a pretty nice after-party that had some great food and a pretty cool 80's cover band. They also had a bunch of free-to-play pool tables. We all had great fun and ate and drank and were merry and stuff. Then we took BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit, it's a train) back to where I parked earlier. Let me tell you that was the longest BART ride I ever had. I had to pee so bad my teeth were swimming in it. I ended up having to go in the women's restroom because there was someone in the men's room and there was no time for politeness for formality. If the women's had been locked I would have been peeing into a trashcan or something.   Thursday I went back to Linux world on a solo mission of justice. I had been cheated of a great bounty of cheap shit the previous trip and I was coming back to clean house, and clean house I did. Four T-shirts, a bank, a mini-USB hub, enough mints and pens to make Mr. T cry. I especially liked the end of the conference on this, the last, day. The roles were reversed, vendors were practically begging people to take their stuff so they wouldn't have any left over. I can't think of one piece of swag that I missed.  There was no after party however, ohh well. Can't win em all ehh? For lunch I ate at a 'Mexican' restaurant in the Metreon. I had a chicken quesadilla and a Sobe, it came to just over $9.00. While eating I was forced to think about the Mexican place I recently ate at in the Mission. This food was bland and almost tasteless, and very expensive, while the food server just a couple miles away was authentic, real, and not very expensive at all. It made me sad to think that things would be so watered down for the people ate at this place. What mostly made me sad was how much I paid for this crappy food. How lame...            "
3389671,male,26,indUnk,Leo,"02,August,2004","       I was telling Miss Macy about my idea that the Smurfs were communist propaganda and she told me to write it in my blog, so here it goes...  First off you have Papa smurf. He takes care of all the smurfs and coordinates the resources of the entire village. He also wears a RED hat, what a fucking commie. All of the smurfs have names that denote what they do in the village. Handy smurf, Heafty, Brainy (?), ect. They all do something, even if it's only just stand there and look good and no matter what they do they all get the same reward for their work. They all have the same house, the same food, and they all want to get some from smurfette but she aint givin' up to any of them. I don't know what that has to do with communism, but it still sucks all the same.  Now this brings us to Gargamel. This is where it gets deep. Gargamel is a capitalist that is always trying to make some cash by turning the smurfs into gold. Or to put it more simply, he wants to make money off of the hard working smurfs. If that doesn't scream bourgeois exploitation of the proletariat I don't know what does.   I don't know what the hell those two prince kids represented, but I'm sure it's something communist.          "

Basically it means that kids under the legal age of responsibility can't be held accountable for wrongful actions/ crime that they commit 'coz they can't yet tell right from wrong, and may not understand what they're doing.  Just what is the 'legal age of responsibility'? Hmm...maybe the argument can be used for certain *ahem* 22 year-olds?  I'd love to plead that case. Especially for me, the  bumbly butter-fingered buffoon .  Well, it was Shawn's 24th B'day party today, though his b'day's tomorrow (that's the surprise!), and I kept doing bumbly things. Like dropping Joy's camera (classic 3 stooges stuff), biting into my plastic fork, and worst, accidentally hitting E-Gene's still-recovering-from-ligament-operation knee. ARGF. After  I was so careful not to. (He was in pain - you should've seen his face.) Oh and did I forget to mention that I left the sandwich maker on and it burnt through it's own rubber insulated wiring? How one day can go so wrong I don't know...sigh...  And it's not just today. It's EVERYDAY. I'm constantly making a fool of myself, either putting my foot in my mouth or causing/being involved in accidents. Charles says I should just try to be more aware, but as you can see from the knee hitting incident, it makes no difference. I'm just bumbly lil' ol' me. Ah wells.....    Enough of my whinging and whining...   Shawn's party was pretty great, organised by his girlfriend Joy. We stuffed ourselves silly with party food like egg sandwiches, pasta and nachos. BURRRRP. And of course, later, the DENSEST CHOCOLATE CAKE EVER. It must have had 50 over eggs in it (I'm extrapolating that figure after considering the fact that a block of Peranakan kueh lapis has 30 eggs in it. I'm not kidding.) ACK...feeling the pain now...  I think the highlight of the party has to be the 'What do I hate/love about Shawn part' where everyone got to air their grievances. For more information, check out  urlLink his Blog  . Let's just say we had a ball of a time...hee hee hee...  Whatever it is, we all had a great time. Too bad Shawn did all the cooking and cleaning up after. :-) Now THAT'S what I call a good party, when the birthday boy prepares his own surprise birthday celebration. (No lah, he's not that pathetic...he was only let in on it 'coz there was no way to get him out of the way. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em! doodeedoodeedoo... His pasta was pretty good though.)

Went with him in the morning, and checked into St Vincent's Private. Not bad - the room is pretty retro - the wallpaper, floor, TV etc. He has his own room and bathroom, so it's cool. The meals are pretty good - I know 'coz i ate his! (MMMM....yummy satay beef skewers on jasmine rice with peanut sauce, caesar salad, bread roll with butter, fruit salad, fizzy lemonade and clear consomme.) He wasn't allowed to eat anything coz of the anesthesia. He could have had something to eat in the morning, but coz we thought the Op was at 11 or 12, the time he checked in, so he didn't have anything to eat. In the end the Op was actually scheduled for 4pm.  Anyways, in the afternoon I left for the Apple store, came back but missed 'seeing him off' to the operating theatre. It was about 5pm, so I hung out at a cafe for the next couple hours, then went to wait in his room and watched TV there. He came back about 8.15-8.20 pm.   He came back looking woozy and tired - he was under General Anesthesia after all. He's now on a morphine drip 'coz he's allergic to other painkillers - and it's self-administered. Hmm...wonder if anyone ends up euthanising themselves by accident...  Anyways, thank God the operation went well. He seems fine, and will probably be out on Friday or Saturday. Check back for more details on this page!     Just a quick update on my iBook situation.    Yesterday I ran a check using Disk Doctor. It was pretty cool 'coz i used it via Wally's Disk Doctor, installed on his Powerbook, through FireWire. I couldn't start up the Disk Doc using the CD so had to use my iBook as FireWire disk, and scan my HD on Wally's Powerbook.  It was so cool! We connected the FireWire cable, pressed T as my iBook started up, and voila! My iBook's contents appeared on Wally's desktop! Woohoo Macs rule!  Anyways, went to the other Apple Centre today. The IT guy there was really nice. I explained what happened, and mention the *ahem* small knock it had.  Told him my dilemma of warranty running out, as well as the countless assignments due. He said no prob, he'll register my problem, so when I go see him again (when I can in a few weeks time after essays are done), the warranty would still cover it. Excellent! So now I have time to do my assignments, and also try reinstalling Word for OS X again to see if that could fix the problem.   (Am doing work on Word for OS 9 right now btw. For non-Maccers, with the new platform, my iBook has 2 operating systems - OS X and OS 9.2. Programmes on OS 9.2 can start up in OS X via Classic mode, which is what I'm doing now with Word. Capeesh?)  The IT guy was pretty cool. He's like one of those 'dude' IT guys lah - streaked blonde hair etc. And he kept saying 'no dramas' meaning 'no problem'. So now it's Charles' (who was also there to collect his new OS X software) and my catchphrase - No Dramas! haha...  Oh yes. Got a poster as well from the place. Pretty nice. It's the iMac - but the old one lah, not the new one. Am planning to pop by other Apple stores to see if they have other posters that are just stocking up...           "
649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"20,May,2002","             It hasn't been a good day.  Firstly, I went to the Apple Store in town and they tell me the problem is probably the software, and the warranty doesn't cover software, only hardware. Then they tell me if I want them to check it out, it'll cost a $90 diagnostic fee, and then they'll give me a quote if I wanna repair the software. If it is a hardware problem, then it's covered under warranty. The whole process will take 3-4 days (or did she say it'll be 3-4 days b4 they get a LOOK at it? Which means it'll take at least 10 days altogether!)  I don't have Norton Utilities or Disk Doctor either. It could very well be a software problem that can be fixed by reinstalling my MS Word for OS X, or even reinstalling OS X itself. But i don't have the MS Office CD right now - it's with a friend.  Thing is, my warranty runs out in 6 days. So if i wanna get it fixed, i gotta do it quick. But i don't have the time to send it in 'coz i really need to finish researching and writing my essays! ARGH.  Basically I just want it done in the quickest way, less stress, NO $$$ spent. Everything costs so much in Australia!!  I'm gonna try another Apple Store near my place tomorrow, and see what they say. I'll call ahead though, and ask how much they charge for diagnostic fees etc. (The place i went to today didn't even take a look at my Mac!)   I think it's horribly unfair that they charge to tell you what's wrong with it. I can understand charging to fix the problem, but not for taking a look at it! Previously they had fixed a problem I had with the iBook on the spot (it wouldn't start up). Today they weren't even helpful! I don't get it.  Sigh...why don't I ever learn?           "

Which means I'll have to backup all my applications etc. and I don't have a CD writer or anything (although I could back it up on iDisk on the Apple servers, but that'll take too long on my 56k modem). I think hopefully my *AHEM* good buddy Charles (nudge nudge) might lend me his external CD-writer so I can back up my stuff.       WHY MUST THIS HAPPEN NOW??      I'm sure there must be a reason for all this to happen, some sort of Big Master Plan or something.  Either that or I should just be less  lun-zun .   Personally, I think it's the latter. Not that I don't believe in a BMP, just that I'm always  lun-zun  ;-)  Charles and E-Gene tell me that all the time. Like how if I could just be more aware, and watch what I'm doing I could avoid lotsa accidents.   But the point is, it's not like I'm not trying or anything. When you're unconsciously unaware, you just ARE. It's not like you can really help it.   Or Can You??    I don't know. I really don't know.   As a famous man once said,      So Help Me God!!               "

Not sure what to do. Plus i have to struggle with the various assignments, and i keep procrastinating.   I think that's (one of) my biggest faults...  Anyways, am eating butter and sugar on bread right now - the poor man's brekky hehe. But it really doesn't taste fantastic on sourdough bread. My advice is, stick to plain ol' white 'lo-ti'.  I got my radio assignment back today. Had overslept and missed class this morning - the second time this week! I was royally pissed that it happened - really wanted to make the class and discuss/workshop my ideas with people 'coz i was  feeling a little lost. Was so upset. Ack. Anyways saw my tutor just before her next class and got back my radio assignment, which i did pretty ok in.  My good buddy Charles got his back too - and i'm pretty upset on his behalf. I read his piece a little before he handed it in, and i really don't think it deserved a P. At the very very least an H3 (the grading system in Melbourne Uni is H1, then H2A, H2B, H3, Pass, Fail). And according to him she sorta 'dissed' his idea for the feature story too.  He wanted to write on Palms - or rather Personal Digital Assistants. Can you believe that she hasn't heard of them? Then again, I'm not surprised...apparently Australia is about 5 years behind in the whole PDA world - like their AUSPUG (Australian Palm Users Group) was just set up recently (as compared to the thriving one in S'pore and the States which have been around for ages). Geez Louiz...  Oh wells, so much for that. He's gonna try to reangle his story, and pitch it again. Hope she takes the bait!  As for me, I'm planning to do my topic on Naturopathy. Like natural healing and all. But i think the story's been done before, so I'm trying to take a fresh approach. I thought of pursuing the angle of people studying naturopathy and why they choose to do so etc., but i realise that it's too narrow for a 2500-wd piece. The most i can squeeze outta this angle is about 1500 wds? And that's the max. So what to do then? (Any ideas, please let me know). I'll prob. see her again on Monday to discuss.  All ritey then. I'm gonna sleep now. Even though i don't really feel sleepy - slept from about 6-10pm just now! eeks..screwing up my whole system. But I'm supposed to wake up early and go for Brekky at this place called Fruits of Passion. It's got really good brekky, but a lil' expensive. Ah wells...pancakes yay!  Nitey nite!

Myers is having a sale, today and tomorrow only, so i ended spending $88 on lingerie!! But i bought like 7 items, so that was pretty worth it (usually 80 bucks only gets you about 2 bras and 1 underwear...).  So yes, am pretty happy. Going crazy shopping i know. I spent 2 hrs there, SOLELY in the lingerie section, while poor Charles had to wander around the department store alone...poor guy.  But all this spending really means i have to get down n search for a job. Eeeks..praying for a good and fun one.  Anyways, we had a nice night after all that shopping...came back to Homebush (my old apt. where Wally, E-Gene and Shawn still reside) and cooked dinner, then had our Monday TV night. Yay, nothing like good food and good company (friends and the telly heehee).  Tomorrow my friend Joanne's supposed to arrive from Canberra for a visit. That should be fun! I'm also supposed to watch 'I am Sam' tomorrow as well, can't wait.  By the way, everyone's vacating Homebush on July 7. Wally's moving to stay with a church friend, Shawn's moving to Jon's place (and therefore becoming my neighbour!), while E-Gene may or may not be returning to S'pore for good. I feel sad..it's like an end of an era or something. Had good times here, plus both Michelle's and Kenneth's places are in North Melbourne.

Yep, i'm back to blogging again...it's been quiet, mostly 'coz i've been tied up with assignments n essays n stuff. But it's the hols now, at least till 29 July!  Been having fun since stuff ended on the 14th. Went skiing at Mt. Buller with E-Gene's family, and that was really fun. His whole family was there, including his sis and bro-in-law and nephew. Boy, the baby's cute! His name's Ethan, and if i knew how to upload a pic onto my blog i would, but sadly...need to find erm, some server or something b4 i can upload pics right? (Hmm... i think i can put it up on my mac site...will check that out.)  Anyways, skiing was really fun, had a ball of a time just tumbling down the slopes hehe....would have loved to ski more, or at least try a longer distance, but it wouldn't have been much fun without E-Gene around...he couldn't ski 'coz he didn't want to risk injuring his knee again.  Watched the England-Brazil match at a pub yesterdat afternoon (the telecast here was at 4.30pm). The crowd was a good mix of Brazilian and English fans, so there was an equal amount of cheering going on. We had originally intended to go down to a pub in the city, but my friend who got there first said it was so packed they were turning people away. So we went to a place on the outskirts of the city instead.   The match was pretty exciting. Let it be known, I'm not exactly a huge crazed fan of soccer, but i do enjoy watching the game now and then, especially between good teams. But i think i still prefer watching it by myself, or with a smaller group of people. I guess when you don't share as much passion about the team as the VB-drinking bloke next to you, it's hard to cheer the team on (and in the process slosh beer on your clothes).   But there were these calm collected group of girls at the next table too, watching the game, having chips and wedges and the occasional Lemon Ruski. They looked as out of place as I did, me with my calm claps, plastic smile, and feeling torn between rooting for England (which my friends were, and i'm 'supposed' to by default as E-Gene is a Liverpool fan...), and Brazil which i kinda liked for their playing skills. Plus Brazil seemed like the underdogs in the beginning after Owen's goal. (AND!! Ashley Cole wasn't too friendly to Ronaldinho who'd placed his hand on the former's shoulder as a friendly gesture, or what i perceived as a friendly gesture at least, only to have Cole shove his arm away. Plus Cole was equally rude to other players later on.   erm, if anyone disagrees, drop a flooble and we can discuss the finer points of soccer etiquette  Which was why my heart kinda tugged towards the Brazilian players after a while...)  Well, two Bacardi Breezers and many contraband hot peanuts (we bought some from the Asian grocer and snuck them in) later, Brazil's in the semi's for the World Cup. No surprises there i guess, although it would've been nice to see England in the semis after all this time...    Wow...i actually sound like i know my soccer stuff huh? Amazing...    Oh wells, anyways, it being the hols and all, i'm trying to find a job now. Either at a cafe or as a sandwich hand or something. Both seem pretty fun to me... :-) Less boring than an office job. But i need a good environment (pple and boss must be nice), good flexible hours (so i can still enjoy the hols, and spend time with my sis when she comes over), and good pay (not too worried about that, pay here is pretty decent, from $10-15 at least, depending on the job). So praying for opportunities...  All rights, almost 1am now, am planning to go to church tomorrow (after a looooong hiatus...bad huh?) so gotta go sleep! Nites!  Okies, it's late. Will write more (hopefully) tomorrow.  Drop me a flooble yah?           "

649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"31,July,2002","               We interrupt our regularly scheduled programme to bring you this groundbreaking news story!    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- This morning at 2.30 am, Miss Sarah Wong, a 22 year-old woman, was admitted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after having an allergic reaction to the anti-flatulence medicine, Mylanta.  The allergy symptom is described as a 'red rash covering the length of the patient's body, with small bumps appearing on her arms and a little on her face and neck.' The patient also suffered from puffy eyes, and a cough resulting from the constriction of her wind-pipes, making it hard for her to breathe.   According to the woman, described by night-shift nurses at the triage station as a 'walking asthmatic lobster with bumps', she had overate during dinner, and thus felt its residual effects - a little heartburn, and 'wind' in the stomach. She then decided to take Mylanta to help ease her discomfort.  Unfortunately, 10 minutes after ingesting the medicine, she felt flushed, and experienced an itching sensation all over her body, which gradually turned into a bumpy rash on her arms and neck. This was when she decided to call her boyfriend who drove her to a nearby hospital to receive treatment.  According to Miss Wong, 'My throat felt tight - probably from the allergy as well, which was why I thought it might be serious. I mean, I've never been allergic to anything in my life before, so I was quite worried.'  After a thorough examination by the doctor, it was pronounced that the Mylanta medicine was probably the cause of the reaction, and not, as suspected, the garlic prawns she had consumed for dinner earlier that night.  'I've had Mylanta once before, but didn't have a reaction then, though I was probably still allergic to it. Apparently the first time I took it, my body was just sensitised to it, which explains why I didn't get a rash then. But this time round, my body just reacted against it.'  After a dose of antehestamines (injected into her system via a drip - a painful first-time experience as well), and a few hours of sleep under observation, the symptoms receded and the patient was free to go home, with instructions to visit the allergy clinic the following week.  'I'm quite thankful that nothing more serious had happened - I hear you can actually die from allergic reactions! Praise God I'm fine now! I'll probably be more careful with what I consume from now on, and will make a habit of reading the labels in detail, checking the ingredients list. I mean what if I end up turning into a yellow banana with fairy wings the next time round? What happens then?'  30 July 2002 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- We now return you to our regulary scheduled programme...           "

Even though it was only for a week, she really made her presence felt, and I mean that in a good way. Just doing the scrapbook for our trtip to Tasmania brings fond memories of a time past recently - last week in fact.  Maybe it's just the thought that I won't see her for quite a while - with her going to Bristol in Sept/Oct and all. She represented, on a deeper level, a link to my family back home. Oh how I miss them all.  Tomorrow is the start of a new term. How did the holidays fly by so quickly? I can honestly say it has been an eventful break, what with all the travelling I've done, and the things I've seen. Still no luck with the job hunt though. Favour Lord, Favour!!  There's still so much to do and see. This semester promises to be a challenging one, with me taking two Film subjects (equating to two 3000 word essays in the middle of the semester! ), hopefully holding fort with a job, and I haven't gotten round to taking those driving lessons I've been saving up for (and which money I have technically spent already on ordinary expenses...). I'm also planning to help out with the Children's Ministry in church, and am also taking an Alpha course, which is sorta a foundation studies thing  - good 'coz it's like going back to the basics of the Bible. Wow - so many things to accomplish - grace needed here!  Well, Shawn's back, which means I see even less of EG 'coz his comp. and best bud are both at Jon's place (Shawn's Jon's new roomie). Woopadeedoo... Everyone always kids that the 2 of 'em are like lovers! (erm, EG and Shawn, not EG and his comp., although now that I think about it, the PC always seems to hum a little when EG's around...) Anyways, the point is, in this little love triangle, I'm the 'concubine' you see. Unless you go by EG's version, which is that I'm the 'wife', the one he's married to, while Shawn's the 'mistress', the one who he really wants to be with. Haha...whatever...  No lah, it's good that he hangs out with his buddy - gives me a lil' space, a lil' of my time you know? So however much I whine that I'll never see as much of EG now that Shawn's back, I'm pretty ok about it, plus I'm glad Shawnie's back too.

649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"25,July,2002","               Chaddy and Dandenongnongnenong   I had a truly wonderful time today. Woke up, went shopping in Chadstone Shopping Mall with my sis, and then drove to Mt. Dandenong where I had terrific devonshire scones, the hugest sundae you've ever seen, and lovely asparagus, chicken and cheese fingers, accompanied by Taylor's tea. Yummm....  Not by myself of course - with E-Gene, Tess and Charles.  Later, it was time spent wondering around looking at nice tea shops and bought essential oils and an oil burner, which unfortunately i cracked much later that night. (No fear, it's still usable - one of those internal cracks caused by sudden change in temperatures when i ran some water over the hot dish).  Added to the depletion in my wallet's funds was the $$ spent on a nice new 3-for-the-price-of-2 book at Border's, which turned out to have a 20% discount for Uni students today. (Charles and EG returned at night to make more purchases).  And that was my day.   Tomorrow should be fun as well - prepping for a b'day party for my sis, who turns 19, and who'll be insisting on wearing the pretty fairy wings she bought today. It'll be a medium-small affair - about 10 pple for a potluck dinner. Little cocktail sausage  hors d'ouevers  anyone?  But tomorrow also marks the 2nd last day I'll see my sis for a really long while. She'll be in Bristol from September/October onwards, for the next 3 years. But she'll be back at least once a year, so that'll be good. Am planning to visit her in Bristol one day, so we can get a Euro Rail pass and travel round Europle. Excitement!  Having Tessa around made me realise a lotta things about myself somehow. In many ways we're so much alike, bumbling, making mistakes as we find our way through life, and it's hard when I realise stuff she does that irritate me probably irritate others when I do it too. Ack. Plus I also seem to nag a lot at her hehe...(which incidentally is very much the same way EG used to nag at me). As she puts it, I tend to treat her like a living doll, often mothering, (even smothering?) her. I guess 'coz I'm too used to being the older sis.  Am trying to let go I guess.   One thing's for sure though, I'm definitely going to be bawling when she leaves on Friday. I can imagine it now, me blubbering away at the airport. Eeek. Really for all the stuff that irritates me when she's here, like not having my own space, small quibbles about inane stuff, I really love having my sister around. Especially 'coz we both share the same warped sense of humour (we're the only 2 idiots who laugh at each other's half-assed jokes, which would usually elicit a loud groan and shake of the head from other people). Underneath certain differences, we   get   each other. Plus it's also cool when we can trick other people over the phone 'coz we both sound the same. Muahahahah....  Ah well, mushy eh?

Spent last Wed to Sun morning in Tasmania, with Charles, E-Gene and my sis Tessa. It was a fantastic getaway, seeing the sights, and generally spending a wonderful time with my sis. Really enjoyed it (I should put up some photos...)  School's starting next week though, which is kinda a drag - where did all the good times go? Plus I'm still on the hunt for a job, which I can't seem to get unless I confirm my timetable. Well, we'll see what happens. This semester promises to be pretty exhausting.  On another note, Mac is gonna start charging me to use the email account and all the other nifty features it has, like iDisk and Homepage. I don't use much of it I guess - mostly just the email account, which is forwarded from my school account anyways. It's just 'coz there's the benefit of having a POP or IMAP account, which means I can d/l me mails. Darn, really dun wanna pay the $$ for it - it's US$99.95 a year, but I get a discount for the first year, so it's $49.95. But it's STILL in US dollars...ack....  Going to Chadstone ('the largest shopping mall in the Southern Hemisphere') and Mt. Dandenong tomorrow. Excited about Ms Marples...this cool English tea place that features, u guessed it, Agatha Christie's Ms Marples character, as it's central character.  Am trying to revamp my blog somewhat  - add in cool stuff, like piccies and I dunno, interesting stuff I guess. Good that Tess is around, so she can help me.   I woke up today with the intention of arriving at 9am in school to help the newbies with enrolment. Guess what time I arrived? 10.45am. Woohoo, that has gotta be a record. In the end, they didn't really need much help, so i just mooshed around, chatting, gossiping, discussing last night's SATC and Buffy episodes (btw, the 2 ep. finale was on tonight - Willow vs Buffy...wooo...scary...to the uninformed, Tara, Willow's gf got shot accidentally and Willow's on this kill-the-world-so-I-feel-better-but-end-up-hurting-myself-and-the-people-I-love rampage. Woah nelly...)  Not that I'm really a fan actually. I just watch it once in awhile when I happen to flip the channel. Demons and witches, pardon me for my lack of liberal-minded thinking, still pretty much freak me out. They might seem harmless on TV, with their wisecracks and all, but that's what the Devil wants you to think doesn't he? Hmmm...  Anyways, time to sleep. Wondering if I should bother to sign up for the Melbourne Blog Meetup or not. Hmm...    Ciao bella!              "
649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"09,July,2002","               The Name Game    I like the name Aidan (Ay-dun). Guess it must be all that   Sex and the City   that I've been watching. I dunno. It just has a nice ring to it doesn't it?  I also like the name Arian, or Arienne, or whatever spelling permutations there are. Pronounced  Ari-ahn  . Or maybe   Ari-ann  .  Nice name for kids don't you think? I can imagine yelling at them to tell 'em dinner's ready. AHHH RIIIIII!!! or DANNY!! Sounds nice eh?  Although I also would like calling my kid by his/her initials too, which is why a middle name is needed. Like CJ or AJ or KC or something. hehe... i once thought of calling my daughter Caitlin Josephine just so i could shorten it to CJ.  E-Gene, sadly, thought naming his kid Aidan Samuel Soh would've been a laugh (yeah we both like the name Aidan. Whoever gets a boy first gets that name! dammit...tick tock tick tock...). Can you imagine the teasing and bullying the poor child would face in the playground? Who wants his kid's initals to be ASS??!! Wah lau eh...damn cruel...  Ah wells, who gets the male mind eh?         "

Everything.  I don't understand why I'm so edgy. I just am.  And it's annoying that it just comes out in tight-lipped strained tones when I speak. I apologise to anyone who had to cross my path today.  I hate that i can't express myself properly, fully, and without whining. As one of my good friends Michelle says, 'Sarah and whining just go together, but we accept it i suppose. It's part of you.'  Sigh.  Sometimes i just wanna lash out and yell words that would make a hard-core sailor blush.           "

649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"02,July,2002","               Coffee, Tea or Me?    Thaaaaaaat's right. I'm becomin' a *ahem* barista, or in more colloquail terms,  ka-fei mei . Yep, just applied at the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf round the corner from my place, and hopefully will get a job there, serving people their cappucinos and cafe lattes. Yay...can't wait.  No seriously. I can't wait. Need money to supplement my expensive habits like shopping, eating and taking public transport. You'd be amazed at how much I spend a week. Not to mention groceries, rent and phone bills.  But being a  ka-fei mei  isn't too bad an idea. I don't really mind it actually, mostly 'coz the hours are flexible, you get to interact with people and you aren't stuck behind a desk and computer. It's fun actually, which is why I'm pretty excited about it, IF I get the job.  The funny thing about Melbourne is, to get any job, you've gotta have a resume. EVEN for part-time work at coffee joints. Strange huh? Back home they just make you fill up a form, and if you look pleasant enough, speak good english, and can tell the difference between a mocha ice-blended and a mocha caramel ice-blended (it's the caramel,  duuhhh ), you're a shoo-in for the job.  Here, they get you to fill in a form, and a resume with REFERENCES mind you, people they can call to vouch for you, just in case you're a schizophrenic psychopath about to suddenly attack customers with scalding hot Special Dutch Chocolate. Can you just imagine that?  Sttstttsttt....must get foam just right, stttststttt, just right, caramel mocha, mocha...waitaminit. Did she just give me FIVE CENTS LESS?   Hey lady, you're five cents SHORT. It's four ninety-FIVE lady, FIVER at the end lady, heard that? Says so on the screen! FIVE CENTS LADY! FIVE CENTS GEDDIT? FIIIIIVVVEEE CENTS!! FIIIIIVVVVVEE WHOLE CENTS!!!! What, you don't know how to count huh? AHHHHHHHHH!!!   and I suddenly launch at the poor unsuspecting woman desperately trying to dig out the coin from her purse with trembling fingers, screaming like a banshee, spilling caramel and creamy milk everywhere, a bulbous vein throbbing at my temple.   Phew!    Erm, in case my future employers are somehow reading this, I'm NOT REALLY INSANE. I've NEVER been institutionalised at a mental hospital before (unless you count my secondary school years...)   Thank you. Just needed to clear that up.  Well, the job's all in God's hands. Praying for it, and going by faith. I really want a job that has a good working environment, good colleagues and boss, good flexible hours, and good pay (it's pretty standard pay here - The Bean'll prob. pay me about $10-12 an hour, a rate I'll never get back in S'pore!). Hours-wise, i wrote on my application form that i'd prefer the morning 7am-12pm slots Tues to Fridays (although negotiable), simply 'coz that frees up the rest of the day, and my sis is coming to visit. And i don't really have to wake up that early 'coz i live pretty near. So praying! They'll probably call me soon to arrange an interview. I'll sell the fact that I can spell most people's names, an asset when writing them down on the plastic ice-blended cups. (can you imagine? The Bean at Junction 8 Bishan spelt my name as Sey-la! Wah lau eh....)  Okies. gtg now. Nite nite.  Drop me a flooble yah?           "
649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"24,August,2002","                Daisies and Daffodils     Oh yesterday was wonderful. Helped out with Daffodil Day, which is basically a day the Cancer Council of Victoria has to raise funds for Cancer Research.  It was really fun - woke up at 6 plus am (can u believe it??!! And I'm NOT a morning person...), went down to Flinder's St. Station and sold all sorts of Daffodil-type merchandise, including pins, ribbons, pens, a cute teddy bear (which was dressed for summer complete with thongs on his paws), a footy ball and bunches of real daffodils! I got to wear this Daffodil Day t-shirt, which I even managed to keep (though I really wanted to keep this yellow pouch we used to collect money in, but couldn't. Shucks....)  So there we were, a bunch of girls at a table outside the station, selling stuff. 3 of us decided to wander down a lil' further, outside Maccers on Swanston St., and managed to sell quite a bit too. We even got our picture taken by this passing photog.  All in all, a really fun start for yesterday. I'd definitely do it again, esp. since it was for a good cause (or as Ew Lee puts it, 'buy a daffodil, support a chawitab...a chawribaba...a cha.. ah-fegget-it, it's for Cancer Research!!') and people do make an effort and come up and support the cause. Best of all,   hello , yellow is   so  my  colour !           "

649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"20,August,2002","               Why?   I don't have a regular job any longer. They told me yesterday, after my shift, that they were implementing a change in the schedule or something, and would call me as and when they needed me. So now it's a casual basis kinda thing. They were pretty vague about a reason why this had to happen, and I was still under shock so I didn't press for details. I figured maybe 'coz they had 2 new pple, this Shanghainese woman and man, who seemed like new partners or soemthing. Ah dunno lah.  I honestly think it's a cheap way of firing someone and letting them down nicely, YET keeping them hanging on your lil' pinky finger so you can depend on a filler when you need someone.  This REALLY sucks. I mean, what the? After 2 weeks of training etc. And I really think I did pretty ok, and got along with everyone. If it was just a trial, tell me it was a trial. I shifted my classes around so I could fit the job in. Now they do this. I have a bleedin' 4 hour break on Wednesdays for goodness sake!  I'd better cancel the scheduled transfer that's supposed to move $$ every week from my bank account to a savings maximiser one. Was planning to put aside $$ each week, earn interest, and have $$ at the end of the semester to fly back home for hols. Now  that  idea's shot.  Happened to my friend, who was working the Mon & Thurs shift too.  This really stinks.  On the upside, at least I'm using the time to get some research done. ONLY 4 weeks left. Haven't done much. Arrrghhhhh.  Stomach hurts now. Gastric and wind. Am not daring to try Mylanta again. Tried 3 other forms of medication though, to no effect. Sigh.  Only looking forward to the presentation for TV Cultures we've been working at. We're gonna majorly impress the pple, and whoop everyone's ass! As Michalengelo (of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) would say,   Cowabunga Duuude!                "
649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"20,August,2002","               Regret   Ever had one of those moments where you coulda shoulda woulda done something if you weren't frozen by nervousness or inertia? One of those moments where you miss an opportunity and it  never really quite comes round again?  Today one of the vendors for The Big Issue came up the tram. He was a well-built old man, his face tan and leathery, his hair silver, and each of the many wrinkles on his gruff visage told of the things he had seen and done. He stood tall, proud, save for a scruffy grey sweater that had seen better days, and a Big Issue vest and sling bag, both worn at the edges.  He sat on the seat in front of me, facing the lady on my left. I stole a quick peek at the cover - a smiling Rachel Griffiths next to a headline for Six Feet Under. I averted my eyes - I didn't feel like buying a copy. True, the money went to a good cause - the magazine employed the homeless to raise funds for the homeless, helping them get back on their feet. But except for the 5 copies I bought last year, when the idea of giving back to society in such a convenient way was still a novel idea, I hadn't approached a vendor to buy one since; I didn't have time to read anyway.  'Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan, young lady?' said the old man to a pony-tailed woman who'd just come up the tram. She just smiled and shook her head.  'You know why I'm asking don't you? he pressed on, the magazine in his hand, a wry smile on his lips. She smiled and nodded, then turned away. 'Yeah, not much of a fan myself, just like the photographs,' he said, smiling to himself, as he twisted the magazine in his hand.  'Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan?' he asked the bespectacled teenage boy that came up next. 'No,' he replied simply.  'Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan?' he asked the lady sitting across the aisle. She shook her head, too absorbed in her own thoughts.  'Are you a Rachel Griffiths fan?' he asked the lady next to me. I looked down at my shoes, then stared straight ahead. He didn't bother asking me.  He got off the tram at the next stop. My heart was pounding, my head was screaming. I should have done something. I could have bought a copy. He'd just fallen on tough times. He could be someone's father, someone's grandfather. He could have saved lives. I could have invited him back for a cuppa, we could have talked. We would both have made a new friend.  I looked out the window, and saw him cross the road to Flinders Street Station. He stood outside in the cold, wrapped in his grey sweater, holding The Big Issue, smoking a cigarette.  The tram moved off. I opened my bag, and saw my wallet. I took it out, looked through, saw that I had a ten-dollar bill, and a five-dollar one.   I could have bought a copy. But I didn't. I was afraid. I was ashamed.   19 August 2002             "
649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"15,August,2002","               It's been awhile...    Yep, sorry haven't been on for awhile, mostly coz v.v. bz with school and all. Subjects this sem are  TV Cultures  (expert on this!!),  MarComm  (although unlike the one i took in Mass Comm...more theoretical),  Italian National Cinema   (must read up on fascism etc etc..), and   Contemporary Hollywood Cinema   (can someone PLEASE explain '2001: A Space Odyssey' to me please??!!)  Special Mention Alert: Welcome PRIYANCA!! Yes, this is my blog....however, if you are reading this right now,   get back to work!!  . Tsk tsk... I wonder what AWARE would think of their brightest young talent if they found out she was spending time reading people's blogs instead of doing her job... tsktsk...hehehe  Am v.v. tired nowadays, mostly 'coz of the early starts. Am NOT a morning person, and I hate having 9 am classes. eep....skipped a couple already. And I have another tomorrow!  The  job so far is pretty cool.  Getting to know the people at work a lil' better, and Jah-mes seems to be loosening up. He's actually a pretty nice guy. :-)   I guess one of the perks of the job are the free coffee and food. I mean the last place I worked at was so anal about making money it charged its employees if they wanted to eat the food there! While they were working! I mean I can understand if any day you just happened to pop by and ordered something, you'd have to pay, but I mean come on, if you've been working there 4 hours in a row and there's no lunch break and if you wanna grab something to munch on while there weren't customers, you still have to pay?? So much for employee benefits.   Phew   I hoped all that made sense.  Whatever it is, I like how the job's going so far. Have decided to take one of the church aunties' advice and put aside a lil' each week (after tithing of course) as part of a savings plan. There's this fund/investment management firm where I can transfer $$ from my bank account, earn interest through them, and transfer the $$ back anytime I want. It's pretty good, and the current rate is 4.75% on yr principal, calculated   daily  , with no other charges, and no minimal principal amount. Sounds pretty good eh? Hopefully can save enough to go for a lil' holiday back home to S'pore at the end of the year. :-)  Okies, enough for now. Here are some things I MUST do, and soon...  1. Stop munching on those addictive Arnott's Mint Slices  2. Reduce chockie intake - just now the house (that's Evelyn, Me, EG, Shawn, Chris, and Jon who wasn't around 'coz he was out) took a stock take and realised that ALL my snacks had choc. content, even the healthy muesli bars...sigh  3. Start exercising - which may be hard 'coz I can't make the Taibox classes this sem, and my ankle's acting up. Btw, haven't even started using my new running gear!! eek...   Oh yes, on this note, just caught a really freaky episode of Smallville, this Clark Kent-in-highschool drama. A pretty-but-plump (aren't we all?) girl was desperate to lose weight so she started drinking veggie shakes made out of veggies found in her garden. Thing is, some meteors from Krypton had landed there when Clark aka Superman landed on Earth, and so the veggies were genetically altered somehow. Everytime she drank them, her fat content reduced dramatically (liposuction w/o the tubes), so she became slim pretty fast! Woohoo...BUT after awhile she started getting really hungry, and the only way she could successfully stave off the hunger was by consuming another being's fat - like a deer, and this mean guy that used to bully her. Hows   that   for revenge??!! Creeeppy...'come one come all, meet the the Incredible Shrinking Girl Who Sucks Up Your Fat!!' eeeek.....   4. Start on essay research, which eek, are ALL due in FIVE weeks time! (one of the classes is TV Cultures, and have been doing   tonnes   of research for it - heheh watching the tube that is....)  5. Finally change the 'Shpiel of the Week'  And now off to bed. I hate early classes. zzzzz  Drop me a flooble or  urlLink SIGN MY GUESTBOOK!!               "
649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"06,August,2002","               A new dawn awaits   All right! I have a new job up, and it's starting tomorrow! Excitment - it's just a simple cafe job, and I'm not sure what my duties exactly are, but it's in school and it's income so I'll try my best. Really need favour in the manager's eyes!  Phew, getting this job was such an ordeal, mostly becasue I've never received any replies to the resumes I sent out over the hols. But maybe it's good 'coz mebbe God wanted me to hold out for this, esp. since in school, and I got to fully devote my time in the hols to doing me-stuff, and hang out with my sis.  Well, the cafe is run by these Shanghainese. I have no either what posessed me to do so, but I spoke to them in Mandarin! Argh, my half-past six broken Chinese. Eek.  It all started innocently enough. I went down to the cafe, dropped off the CV, spoke to the manager in English, he in his Chinese-accented English too.  The following week, I got a missed call from them, so I called back. The guy I spoke to (who wasn't the manager though), started speaking to me in Mandarin, so that's how it all started. I went down the next day with my timetable, and spoke to the manager in Mandarin, thinking, after all, hey I handled a whole conversation yesterday in the language, I can do this too. The manager seemed a little surprised at my speaking Mandarin though. Whatever it was, I was really proud of the fact I asked for his name before I left in the polite Mandarin form:    Oh, dui bu qi, qing wen ning gui xing?   (Oh excuse me, by the way, may I know your name?)  To which he replied: Oh,   Jah-mes    Teeheeheee...yeppers,  Jahmes  teeheeeheee  He called later that week, woke me up on a Friday morning, asking me (in Mandarin of course) if I could start work the following week. YES!! I was really happy - Praise God! Thing is, that early in the morning, ( 11  a.m. mind you - I mean who wakes up at   such  an ungodly hour?), I couldn't form the proper words to reply in Mandarin. So you can imagine how the conversation went:    Qing wen ze shi Huang xiao jie shi ma?   (Pardon me is this Miss Wong?)    Ahh..shi shi!   (Yes, yes!)    Wo shi chong XXX cafe da lai de.   (I'm calling from XXX cafe.)    Oh dui dui dui!   (Oh yes yes yes!)    Oh dui dui dui.  (Was he making fun of me??)  Qing wen ni zhao dao gong zuo le ma?   (Oh yes yes yes. May I ask if you've found a job yet?)    Oh hai mei you.   (Oh not yet.)  Blah blah blah...I was really struggling with it. He was asking me if I could shift my subjects around so I could work on Tuedays and Wednesdays. I just simply couldn't articulate properly what I wanted to say, and had to repeat myself a couple of times, peppering my broken Mandarin with a smattering of English words, like Timetable etc. Ughhh.  Finally, after everything was settled, I was about to say bye when he said,     Ni de hua yu jiang de bu tai hao hor?   (Your Mandarin really isn't very good is it? -> said as more of a statement than a question)   I was stunned to say the least. So I just said the only thing that popped into my head.    Hah??   (Hah??)    Wo shuo ni de hua yu jiang de bu tai hao hor?   (I said your Mandarin isn't very good is it?)    Oh dui, er, nah shi ying wei, er, Ying Wen shi wo di yi ge, er, language.   (Oh yes, er, that is because, er, English is my first, er, language.)    Nah ni jiu jiang Ying Wen ba.   (You can speak in English then.)    Oh hao, hao.    (Oh, yes yes -> I mean I really didn't know what to say. It just threw me! Sigh - Shanghainese are famous for their bluntness)    Xia ge xing qi jian.   (I'll see you next week then.)    Ah, dui.   (Ah, yes.)  E-Gene, who overheard the conversation, put it very succintly: 'Man, your Chinese really sucks!'  Sigh.           "

Pour spoonfuls of spaghetti sauce on top of the brinjal 4. Repeat with additional layers of brinjals and sauce until desired height 5. Top off with a sprinkling of cheese (parmesan, mozzie, tasty, chedder, swiss, whatever you like) 6. Bake in oven till cheese has melted (I usually put it at a really high temperature so I don't have to wait too long...but that means you gotta watch it so it doesn't burn)  Voila! Yummy brinjal-lasagne!             "
649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"24,September,2002","              What a day...  I spent a very enjoyable weekend so far. Friday was spent at the DFO near Moorabin airport, with lotsa nice cheap stuff to buy...got a pair of Just Jeans for $39.95, and EG bought me a pair of slippers for $12. And I got sidetracked by a $12.95 top which I was totally indecisive about, and I didn't buy in the end...was too conscious that I'd eventually decide it wasn't flattering after I bought it and wouldn't wear it in the end...eep...  Yesterday was a great day spent with some church friends, a bunch I got closer to through the Alpha course we take in church. We had Yum Cha, then watched The Bourne Identity (featuring many out-of-focus shots), then watched a lil' footy (it was the Grand Final after all - the Brisbane Lions beat the Collingwood Magpies 75-66) on the big screen at Crown Casino while our friends played a lil' rapid roulette hehe...  I think it was pretty great when we came back and hung around, playing cards and a lil Twister. All in all, a very enjoyable day spent with them. I know how I've totally not really felt comfortable at ACCF, primarily because of the lack of a group of pple to hang out with, mostly 'coz they were  Aussie-Asian so there was a huge difference when we talked, even for simple slang terms and the wavelength. But this bunch is pretty cool - mostly Malaysians, but still got the   lors   and the  lahs  hehe... It's a great funny bunch of people - funny as in we laugh a lot.  Last night me EG and Shawn (and Evie for a lil' while) played Upwords...imagine the ingenuity that is involved when you really can't build any more words...we came up with stuff like 'Quita' (for quitter, said 'hood-style), 'Sista', 'Gemz', and we allowed Shawn's 'Fie' 'coz it's Ye Olde English...hehe. I really like playing board games with people, it's fun. I remember how every birthday and Christmas 'til I was 12, I'd get my parents to bring me to Toys R Us so I could get boardgames. I had Payday, Monopoly, Go for Broke, The Game of Life, Taboo (bought it on my 12th Christmas, and am still playing the game 10 years on, even though the set is a different one 'coz I lost the old one) and lots more. I loved, and still do love, boardgames...  My new obsession right now is crosswords puzzles, which I do with EG or whoever is available to hazard a guess at a seven-letter word for 'practiced boxing' (answer below*). That said, I'm stumped at an eight-letter word for 'announces'. The 6th letter is an R though...anybody can help? Please post a flooble or a bl00p if you have any clues....thanks!!     * The answer is 'Sparred'           "

Quick trivia: Did you know that Citizen Kane was supposedly based on his life (Hearst I mean, not Hermann).  The Cat's Meow is based on the novel written by Elinor Glyn, about what really happened on a yachting trip in 1924. Actually, 15 November 1924, to be exact - hehe my birthdate! ooooooooh...  Movie and the webstie have really nice 1920s-style songs...it's actually playing in the BG as I type. And the Charleston dances they did seemed pretty funky too hehe.

649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"22,September,2002","               Yueah Babay...   I have returned from watching Goldmember. Hmmm...dunno why, didn't laugh as much as I thought I would...maybe my expectations were a little high? I know, I know...how do u have high expectations when u watch Austin Powers right? But no, I actually like watching shall we say, *Doctor Evil-style finger quotes* 'stupid'  movies...like American Pie, Road Trip (although Tom Green was *trey* gross) and the list goes on...  Overall, i think the best part of the show was the cameos in the beginning and the West-Side Story song n dance sequence... pretty nifty legwork I would say. Beyonce Knowles had great abs, bland acting - no sparkles there.   The highlight was doing the typical Singaporean thing after the movie - supper! Except it was more like dinner 'coz we hadn't eaten. We took our first trip to Bismi! A regular Prata shop, in Melbourne! With yummy prata and teh tarik, and it was pretty cheap too...full meal (2 pratas n tarik) for only $4.90. Yummers...  Oy...so full now... edge of puking.  My sis is leaving for Bristol tomorrow night. Just reading her blog makes me sad in away, like she'll be so much further away - it's not just a 2-3hr time difference anymore (depending on daylight savings), but much much more - the other end of the world! I will really miss her.   Somehow I feel and wish I could be a better sis n I dunno...be able to give her greater emotional support. I think I'm prob. one of those 'church'-type people who she referred to in her blog, who don't really know what to say and give tried-n-true advise, 'coz I probably don't understand the emotional turmoils she goes through. I'm less angsty I guess. The 2 of us are quite different in many ways, even since we were young. She tended to rebel and question the system, and still does (which i'm very proud of actually, she doesn't just accept things 'as they are', unlike me), while I just happily went about my way... sure we'd fight all the time thought - hated each other when we were kids, and I really thought she was a pest when I was in secondary school  - i remember once, when i went back to get my 'O'-level results, n she popped by to find out how i did (she was in Sec 1 then), and I was like 'Why you come?...aiyah just go back to your class lah'. I guess I really hurt her then. And even when she started hanging round my friends, like the Old Awake friends, and the Tsunamit people - i guess i didn't like her infringing on my 'territory'.  Irony is, she's prob closer to them now than I ever was... :-)  I think one thing that stands out vividly in my mind when we were kids was that she always had a flair for the dramatic. On a trip to China, she stood at the front of the bus, in her little white jumpsuit and rainbow-coloured checked shirt, and sang into the mike connected to the bus' audioo system, while everyone clapped and cheered along. Wah lau eh - attention seeker! haha...But there was a really sweet side to her too. We had had a fight, or a brawl should i say, what with the pinching scratching hairpulling etc. I think i hit her too hard, and she started crying and ran to my mum, who took the cane out. I ran to the corner, and was really prepared for a whacking man, 'coz she really looked pissed. And then my sis ran in front of me, spread her hands out, and said 'No! Don't beat   jie jie !!' So sweet right? In my head I was thinking 'Wah lau eh, trying to act again! Watch too much Channel 8 serials ....' but at the same time still relieved coz my mum's face softened....haha :-) Oh the stories of childhood.  To Tess, if you're reading this b4 your flight tomorrow. Take care, God bless, and you'll do fine in Bristol. I love you very very much.  Goodnight.           "

How intertextual/postmodern is that? A reading of me reading my readings while participating in the reading of televisual forms. Burp.  Ever tried speed reading? I did what I was taught eons ago in secondary school - place a finger in the middle of the sentence, and try to read the whole thing without moving yr eyeballs. Theory is to encapsulate the sentence at a glance, letting your mind fill in gaps in the sentence (ie pick out key words). IT'S NOT POSSIBLE without incurring any serious injury. Verdict: V.V. painful, only try if you're already   pah ciao    I saw my TV Culture's lecturer at the gelati place just now - what a coinkidink (sarah-speak for 'coincidence').

649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"13,September,2002","               Feminista   I've recently come across this website, called  urlLink Big Bad Chinese Mama  . It's a really interesting website posing as an asian mail order bride service that serves to, as the manifesto says, catch men in the act (of porn-ing).  I sent the website's url round to a couple of close friends, little knowing the stir it caused. But it was a really good stir, as in we started debating about the site's effectiveness at subverting patriarchal oppression, whether it's too controversial and nihilistic with the male-bashing and all.  This was what I wrote:   In my humble opinion, I figure that our resident big bad mama is not simply ranting against the patrairchal standards of today. However much we can argue about gender equality, about our roles in society, about men and women walking hand in hand towards that great light of peace and harmony, she is using humour as a way to deconstruct the ideologies of femininity today. (I've personally used the same approach, albiet in a less confrontational way, to satirise the global female fashion industry in my project for class last year - yes yes, boast boast teeheehee)  It's a pretty in-your-face, confrontational gesture i suppose. What I think is good about the site is that it stands to subvert current norms of thinking, through parody. Yeah, we're pretty much living in a post-everything world, post-feminist, post-modern yadayada. The fight has been fought, the battle has been somewhat won, but the war for equality still goes on (wow, how prosaic...). Like Velle said, the branches of feminsism stretch far and wide; i think it's all down to the whole personal-as-political approach again - i.e. if you feel that women and men play diff roles, so be it. If you feel we should use whatever power we have (sexual or otherwise) to do whatever we can to climb to the top and change things from within , so be it.  Personally, I'm more of the humour-works-to-deconstruct kinda thing. Mostly 'coz (a) my kinda humour does not serve to uphold my pretty lotus blossom image (yes i can hear the coughs in the background! i know who you are!!), and (b) i have a pretty wacked out sense or humour and damn, i'm proud of it!  Also, i think the fact that we're debating and thinking about it (the website as well as feminism at large) legitimises the topic anyways - yay! one up for the womyn!!   Another point I want to make is also this:  The fact is, that the issues for women today lies not in debating about feminism, or taking up the cause or whatever. When we discuss women's issues casually,  (even with the same women who took my feminsit film n tv theory class last sem), and I say that i'm a feminist, it's always greeted with a blank stare and 'oh, so what do you do?'. Everyone equates feminism with activism and the bra-burning butch stereotype. I think feminism today is more subversive, and with the use of new technology (unfortunately a world equated with the techno-geeks-are-usually-men idea), that's what bigbadchinesemama.com aimed to do.  I mean I told my friend I use to clean my boyfriend's bathroom for him, and she said 'oh, you're definitely not a feminist that way'. I had to explain, firstly I liked cleaning bathrooms coz it was cathartic for me in a weird way (must be all the fumes i've been inhaling from the Jif bottle), and secondly he wasn't free to do it and we needed to get it sparkling for the real estate agent's inspection, and thirdly it's nice to do something for someone, man or woman. If she had asked me to clean her bathroom for her, I would have (if and only if it wasn't in too deplorable a shape!!!).  Sigh...the defences we have to keep coming up with...

It was pretty far from Melbie though, in Upper Plenty, so far it was hardly on the Melway map. Eep. But the place was so fantastic! The  dorm rooms, the toilet, all really neat and clean, esp. the bathroom. All the amenities you needed, great food plus A REAL FIREPLACE. What more could you ask for!?!!  We spent the 2D/2N there enjoying each other's company, and learning more about the Holy Spirit - part of the Alpha course I'm taking at church, sorta like a foundation back-to-basics of Christianity kind a thing. Real good stuff.  EG had a great time too. Probably 'coz there was some serious male bonding going on. Him and a bunch of other like-minded noisy guys, sitting around after lunch, talking about cars n stuff. SO blokey...I made my friend Alan promise never to turn into them, guys sitting around congratulating themselves on being the masters of the universe. He said no guarantees there. Sigh. What happened to all the Sensitive New Age Guys?   One highlight was learning Mafia, this really interesting game where someone gets 'killed' and you gotta find out who did it. Think Murderer meets Bluff meets Survivor and you get the gist. 3 Mafiosi, 1 Doctor, 1 Spy, and the rest are Civilians (9 people in all, plus 1 Game-master). You should see the heated debates as everyone tried to defend themselves and prevent who they thought were compadres from being voted out. VERY layered game, and you never know who's bluffing. Very fun, and also very interesting 'coz you've got this group of Christians who are essentially lying to each other...hmmm....hehe  Anyways, it was a great experience, and I'd definitely do it again if I had the chance.

To the unenlightened, Silly Songs are basically ditties that just pop into my head once in awhile, outta blue, totally off-guard. They could be lyrics to well-known songs (a la Weird Al Yankovic) or just, well, songs with a tune.  Here's a sample:   (To the tune of Kylie's 'I Just Can't Get You Outta My Head')   I just can't get you outta my spleen Boy oh boy do I need anti-fungal cream   Also:   (To the tune of P.O.D.'s 'Alive')   I can't see at night For the very first time I believe I am blind So blind  I can't drive past nine Otherwise I'll die But night blindness is fine So fine     Anyways, I just came across, in one of my readings, a man named Philip J.

649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"30,October,2002","              The Day When Many Things Happened  Let's start at the very beginning...a very good place to start...   12 pm   Woke up feeling really shitty, 'coz the night before I was all tense about my Italian Cinema take home exam question, which I had no idea how to write 'coz it had to center around 2 specific topics from a list. One topic, Migration, I could relate to the film (Looking for Alibrandi), but I had absolutely no clue which other to pick.  So I just read my Bible, and it seemed specifically tailored for me, talking about how we should rejoice in trials. To quote some movie I watched, 'That which doesn't break us only makes us stronger'. Was it Arnie? I don't remember.  So I decide to just pick one of the topics,  Mezzogiorno , and find out more about it, 'coz (a) it was part of the week's readings on Post War politics, which I could possibly link to Alibrandi and Migration, and (b) 'coz I wanted to know what it actually meant in English.  Typed in a search in askjeeves, and voila! It basically refers to the South Italy region, encompassing Sicily, Calabria etc. Woopee! Italian-Australian immigrants always harken back to their homeland, esp. Sicily, and it was done so in Alibrandi. Yay! Praise God.   1.30 pm  Mobile phone rang and I ran to pick it up. The caller ID said 'Anonymous', so it was from a private number. 'Hello? Is this Sarah?' 'Yes, it is.' 'Hi, I'm Mike from Gloria Jean's Coffees? I received your email early this morning. Could you come in sometime for an interview?'  In short, I'm meeting Mike, who's wearing a black shirt, tomorrow regarding a position as a barista/customer service staff at a new store they're opening on Bourke Street. Praise God for opportunities. I also applied for another job, a Call Centre one (answering questions on an upcoming govt. campaign), but they haven't got back to me.   3.15 pm  Am still on the bleeding tram when I should be in class already. I'm giving a presentation for my Italian Cinema class!   3.25 pm  Phew, class hasn't started yet. Prayer really works.   3.55 pm  Presentation went ok. Everyone was anxious to go to the pub (rest of tute lesson @ pub.  Cool huh?) so they weren't really listening. What to do, it's the last tute for the semester. Anyways, didn't join them - on to the next presentation, for TV Cultures.   4.00 pm  Well the Multimedia festival went well, though it ended late. Everyone's presentation was really good! Sadly, ours didn't win a prize (4 prizes for 7 groups, plus door prize draws). My 'honourable mentions' go to the group that talked about Phua Chu Kang and syntax, and also the guy that did celeb impersonations of Ozzy Osbourne and Bill Cosby talking about global television. V. funny.   8.00 pm  Doors open for the John Mayer concert! YAYYYYY!!   8.30 pm  Charlton Hill, an Aussie group sporting a cute front man perform. Really rocked the crowd. Not bad tunes - esp. the radio single, 'Two's Company' (at least that's what I think the title is).   9.45 pm   JM comes on stage!!! YAY!!!!  It was a fantastic concert, and the crowd was good, rocking and rolling along. I must say a lot for his musicianship - he's pretty good at the guit., and his voice is great too. He's fabulous to see 'live' too  - interacted with the crowd and all. Overall, nice prep/rock look - he was wearing a shirt, which was drenched by the end of the night.  Hehe, we sneaked in an MD player and recorded the entire thing! Although I talked at a couple of instances. And sang along too. Eep. Hopefully my voice doesn't come out, so the recording doesn't turn into  'John Mayer in Melbourne - the Karaoke Version'.  Charles read on his website that JM's actually fine with pple recording his performances, esp. since it's a good form of promotion. As long as $$ doesn't change hands. It's fine to let your friends have a copy and all. Now that, I think, is the right attitude to have. With all the hoo-haa over piracy and music and downloading MP3s and all, sometimes it's nice to have an artiste not being so  ngim-jim  over money. I mean, the record companies are having hernias over the whole piracy issue, mostly 'coz of the money they say they're losing. Get with the program - not making AS MUCH as you thought you would does NOT qualify as a loss. Most times they don't just break even, they have lotsa profits. Hello, Metallica?  Well, spending those few hours bouncing up and down was really fun, esp. since I got to share it with my 2 best friends in Melbourne, EG and Charles. We were standing in front of the speakers (oh my poor ears, I should have brought my ear plugs. They're still ringing now, more on the left ear though), @ the left side facing the stage. Irritated EG a lil' though, 'coz he was the designated photog. (he being tall and all), and I kept bugging him to take more photos. 'How many shots of him singing do you want? One with every light change issit?' 'No lah! But if can change angle also good lor. Maybe I should go the other side to take?' 'Tell you what lah. I'll scan the photo and then flip it around for you ok?'  Hehe.  Highlight of the concert? I went home with a souvenir - a signature guitar pick that one of his roadies threw in my direction after the concert. Yippeee!  Next up, Emily of Emerald Hill on Thursday. And possibly Bic Runga next month. (I'm still lamenting the Jamiroquai concert though. Really wanted to get tix early on, but no one to go with! Finally found out Johanna's going, but she's got tix already, and they're seated ones, not general admission  - apparently the GA ones are sold out.

Speaking of which, there's a new ad on TV right now featureing fishes swimming around a baby in his cot - for some sorta baby monitor by Fisher and Paykel I think. Not sure - if anyone has seen it, let me know.  It's essay crunch time again, which means I've been  piahing  or at least trying to  piah  for my essays, 1 due next Friday, and 3 due the following Friday. As you can tell, my days are packed and dreary, and I've gotten to know the Law Library pretty well, at least the section where I spend sitting on my butt and reading/typing.  On an upside, next week are the John Mayer and Emily of Emerald Hill performances. Quite excited for it. Yes, I know, strange that I'm going to see Ivan Heng in drag (once again) as everyone's favourite  bibik  in Melbourne, when I can see him in drag back home, but I think tix are much cheaper here - only paid $19 for an evening show. Plus the theatre's so close to home, I can walk there. I wanted to check out other shows as part of the Melbourne festival too, but unfortunately, with essays and all prob. don't have the time.  Am also on a job hunt for Nov/Dec/Jan summer hols. This Customer Service Rep. job sounded quite promising, and they pay $16 an hour, so that's good. But I gotta revamp my CV first though, 'coz I think I need to sound more dynamic in order to get the job, instead of just blah blah, I did this and that. I'm taking tips from this guy at the seek.com.au website too. Now I just have to get around to doing it b4 they close applications.  On an upnote, tomorrow me EG n charles are finally going to the IMAX theatre b4 our 3-month ticket expires. Such a waste of money if we don't get around to using it!  Anyways, I'll prob. write more interesting stuff next week. Not that my life is entirely very interesting anyways hehe.   Tata  Oh yes, btw on Chuckie's recommendation, check out   urlLink this guy . We're planning to do something like what he suggests, giving out useful items and maybe cookies during Christmas, to the homeless.           "
649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"13,October,2002","               Bel's B'day  I spent yesterday and today with Bel, celebrating her 22nd birthday. It was very enjoyable - yesterday we had a picnic at Fitzroy Gardens, with E-Gene. I got her a picnic lunch for her b'day (sigh, which I still feel is a kinda cheapo prezzie...) and also baked a cake. We had sandwiches, potato gems, crackers with kabana sausages and tasty cheese, herb and garlic cheese spread, strawberries and apples, and coke to wash it down. Throughly enjoyable, and the company was good :-)  Today we went to South Melbourne beach - took the tram down. We spent a couple of hours on the sand, talking about stuff, from relationships to people to school. Then had tea at a cafe and talked some more. Then had dinner with people from her church - mostly her housemate, Jean's friends, one of whom I found out much later was Wally's housemate! Wow...hehe. Dinner was fun, at this place called Malaya Inn in Doncaster - nice yummy food like  Or Jian  (fried oyster omelette), fish head curry, sambal kangkong etc. And even bowls of chicken soup! Mmmmm... It was followed by coffee at Brunetti's, which I hadn't been to since it's renovation. Didn't stay long though, 'coz Charles n EG came to pick me up soon, after their dinner and M1 concert.  The people I met today seemed really nice - would like to hang out more with them if I could. Nice to get to know new people. I'm also beginning to hang out more with a bunch of people from church, which is great (and a long time coming, considering I've been at ACCF for more than a year). Guess I'm finally fitting in and finally finding my place in the scheme of things - esp. 'coz of Alpha.  Btw, I've graduated from Alpha course on Wednesday, with my own certificate and everything! Alpha is sorta a back-to-basics course in Christianity, which EG and I attended, and after many months, finally finished it off reinforcing the knowledge we have, and making many new friends!  Anyways, back to today. I'd wanted to bring my camera and take lotsa pics, so that I could stick it into an album or collage for Bel to remember, but ARGHFFF!!! Forgot the camera!! Sigh...sad right? There goes a nice prezzie idea...  Chatting with Bel was nice. It's interesting how our friendship had evolved - I never really liked her from the start (which she tells me is what happens with practically every girl she meets - they automatically don't like her for some reason, so poor thing right? She says sometimes she acts a lil' bimbotic, just to seem more affable to people, 'coz she's naturally assertive. Me, I don't have that problem - I'm naturally bimbotic! heheheh). I didn't like her then 'coz I must admit I was a lil' intimidated by her, 'coz she's quite confident and assertive (and also very babe hehe, which I still think so), plus her manner wasn't very, I dunno, warm n friendly? A little aloof sometimes, and when she was friendly, she seemed superficial, and very PR. Plus we didn't have much in common to talk about too.   But we get along better now, and talk about stuff. She made a good point, that we should try to hang out when we're both in S'pore, or it'll seem like we just hang out with each other here and now 'coz we don't have any other close girlfriends here. Thinking about it, it's partly true though, 'coz Bel and I aren't exactly personality matches in a way - but that's 'coz our friendship is still progressing. Let me explain.  I personally think everyone has friendships with others on different levels. Like how I interact with people like say Charles, or Velle and Priyanca, is different how I interact with Bart, is different from how I interact with Bel, different from how I interact with my housemates, and different for EG (of course). With the first category, and also with my housemate Evie, I'm a lil' crazier and silly, and loonier . But when I'm with EG or Shawn, a lil' less loony and loud ('coz EG keeps telling me I'm too loud), with Bart I'm more affectionate, and with Bel I'm more sedate, 'coz we're still establishing our friendship, and haven't come to that super-comfortable point yet. I think the true litmus test will be to see her reaction to one of my Silly Songs! Then I'l know...hehehe            "
649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"10,October,2002","               My Mobile Phone...Literally (Part 2)   I walked slowly towards the tram stop... all the while feeling sad, and praying. 'Oh Lord...help!'  Suddenly I stopped in my tracks. Waitaminit! Wait a minute! Before I left the lecture hall, I threw a plastic bag into the bin. Now it had made an unusually loud 'thunk' when it landed, which was why I picked it up again and looked at the contents of the bin. But I didn't see anything, so figured maybe a can or something just toppled over when I threw the plastic bag in.  That 'thunk' could've been my phone! As I recall, I was holding my phone in my right hand - I must have let it go along with the plastic bag!  Excitement bubbled up inside me. I ran for the security station again, praying in tongues all the while. Panting and out of breath, I knocked on the window. 'Angelo! I..gasp..think...gasp...it could be in..gasp...hold on, I'm gasping too much...'  I explained my theory, and he just laughed good-naturedly. 'Sarah! You're killing us!' He called Keith again, and I ran to meet him at the underground parking garage to walk back to the theatre.  We walked back in anticipation, as I apologised to Keith for making him walk back there again. I was telling God, 'if I can find it, I'm just gonna say 'Thank You Jesus!' and use this as testimony man! I was so sure...   We reached the theatre, and I ran for the bin. Pushing my sleeves up, I dug into the bin, which housed a few coffee cups, my KFC plastic bag, and used tissues. No phone.  But I knew I heard a 'thunk'! So I shifted the bin aside, and lo-and-behold, it was there!! Neatly resting against the wall, undamaged.  WOOPADEEDOOO PRAISE GOD!!  I jumped up and down in excitement, and even grabbed Keith's arm, shouting 'Thank You, thank you!' He smiled, and said, 'That's ok, as long as you don't make me come back here again!' I grinned back.  We walked out, and I kept thanking God. I suddenly remembered that I had promised to proclaim Jesus' name in this situation, and I'd forgotten to. Suddenly I felt nervous about it saying it out loud. I whispered loudly 'Thank you Jesus.' - don't know if Keith heard.  I realised I was being a chicken about it, so as we were walking I said, 'Wow, that's amazing, I really thought I'd lost my phone!' Keith turned and nodded. 'Yeah, it's really a MIRACLE that I found it, I mean, most people never find their phones! I really THANK GOD man. It's just so amazing. AMEN, amen!', I said, stressing on the erm...Christian-sounding words...  As we emerged from the shortcut through the carpark, I looked up at the sky, and suddenly everything seemed so beautiful to me. The trees, the damp ground, the cold air. I raised my hands a lil', and whispered 'Thank You Lord.'     EPILOGUE  I walked back towards the guard station with Keith. Before he left, I said thank you agian, and asked for his name, giving him mine as well - just in case we ever bumped into each other again around the campus. I walked up towards the guard window and waved at Angelo through the glass, holding my phone up for him to see. He smiled. (Praise God btw, that the bunch of us were the last few to leave - that way I knew who was locking up, and so could locate Angelo at the guard station.)  I boarded the tram, and thanked God once again for his blessings. I bumped into another friend on the tram, and shared my testimony with her .  Our God's really an awesome God!              "
649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"09,October,2002","               My Mobile Phone...literally   I walked towards the tram yesterday, as the wind blew and the last hints of twilight shone in the sky. It was about 6.40pm, and I'd just spent a good 45 mins or so just chatting with Jessie after lecture, while she waited for Tammy to finish class. I had a nice time, just having coffee and talking about school - Jessie's so easy to talk to.   Anyway, since it was pretty close to dinner time, I figured I'd better give EG a call n let him know I was on my way back. I reached into my jacket pocket...and found it empty!  'Arrrgh! Where could it be?' I checked my bag, rummaged through it. As the pit of my stomach started to swirl, my brain kicked in. 'I probably left it in the lecture hall or something. Better go find the security guard who locked it.' So i ran to the station, hoping to somehow locate the guard. He was there! Manning the station! Angelo was his name, a guy in his late 20s-30s, and he was kind (and friendly) enough to call another guard to walk with me back to the theatre, which was right at the other end of campus.   So me and Keith, this tall man with a moustache, probably in his 40s, walked in the cold back towards the theatre. 'Where else do you think it could be?'  'I don't know. The Baillieu Library probably...'  'Have you checked it?'  'No, not yet. Probably later.'  We walked up the steps to the theatre. I walked in, and searched the area where I sat. No phone. He looked up and down the theatre steps too. No phone either.  'Sigh, it's ok, I'll check with the library. Thanks!' 'Yep.'  I walked back towards the library, where I'd gone with Jessie to zap lecture notes. I put on my jacket there, so I figured it must have slipped out then. I checked with the librarians and the lost-and-found counter there. No deal. I tried calling EG on the payphone, and Jon's house phone, but no one picked it up.  My heart dropped as I registered the fact I'd probably have to spend a few hundred bucks to get a new phone. Money that I found hard to part with. All this while, I was begging the Lord 'please, Lord, please...', yet was resigned to the fact it was probably gone. People adhere to the finders-keepers mentality over here - I lost my sunnies a month back, and never saw it again. Let alone a phone!  I walked in dark back to the cafe where I had coffee with Jessie. It was probably closed though - it was already 7 plus. The ground was damp, the air cold. I shivered as my toes gripped my Birkie sandals. A light! People were still there! I knocked on the glass door. 'We're closed!' said the girl on the inside. I knocked again. She gestured with her hands, that they were closed. 'Hey John, there's someone at the door knocking!' she said in a nasal voice. John looked up. 'I'm sorry, we're closed'  DUH, I knew that already.  'I'm sorry, but did you guys see a mobile phone in here?' I yelled through the glass door. 'What?' 'I said I think I left my phone in here!'  He opened the side door, and I explained myself. 'Sorry, we just cleaned up, and didn't see anything.' 'Oh, it's ok' 'I'll leave a note in the the cafe, in case I find anything, so you can check back tomorrow?' 'Thanks.'  I trudged on, towards the Student Union info desk, in the vain hope that someone might have picked it up. It was closed.   I scrounged through my bag again, then decided to return to the library to call someone. The only other number I had memorised was Charles', so I called him. 'Charles!' I squawked, 'I lost my phone!'  'Huh? How?' 'Don't know lah. Must have dropped it somewhere. Do you have Chris' number? I'm trying to call pple at home but no one's picking up!' 'Ok, hold on ah...'  He gave me the number, and I lamented how I'd have to buy a new phone. He offered to sell me his other phone, the one he had but wasn't using at the moment. I said see how, still praying that I might find it.  I tried calling my phone, in case the person who found it picked up. Or at least if it was switched off, at least I knew for sure it was gone and could move on. It rang. And rang...and rang. It was on vibrator mode though, so maybe whoever had it didn't hear it.  I retraced my steps again. No phone. I gave up.     tune in tomorrow to read the next episode of... My Mobile Phone...literally              "
649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"08,October,2002","               Why?    Why is it   that you can never repeat that fresh-from-salon look, even after spending hours adding mousse to your hair?  My hair looks more bobbish than sleek n funky. I don't know how the guy at the salon did it, with his creme and his scrunching fingers, but it looks weird now....sigh. Or maybe 'coz I'm trying to do it with bed-hair, and not freshly blown & washed hair. Whatever it is, I can't repeat the look. Sigh...sob.    Why is it  that even though your body is aching and tired, your mind is still awake so you just can't fall asleep?  I spent the other night in an insomniac stage, and ended up watching informercials. I am actually seriously considering buying one of the products, Winsor Pilates from the website! Hmmm...    Why is it  that even though I have things to do, like essays and such, I can never fully concentrate on them?  Instead I end up getting distracted by TV and the like. Oh there's the computer, oh, maybe I'm hungry...hmmm maybe I should go mend the hole in my t-shirt...    Why is it  that even though I have school later, and I haven't done my readings, and my stomach's rumbling 'coz I haven't had lunch, I'm still stuck here blogging, drawn like a moth to a flame?

649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"01,October,2002","               Highlights of the Day    I streaked my hair RED!! And cut it short, till about chin-length. It was a very interesting experience at the hairdresser's, considering how it's actually a hair college - Pivot Point.   After months of looking longingly at the model on the poster at the salon, I finally did it. I love it actually...very vivid colour, and the cut's pretty good too. Everyone seems to think so (hehe), I got reviews from 'wicked!' and 'gorgeous!' to 'don't go back to long hair in a hurry!' and 'eh, quite nice ah, hor?'  Anyways, as I was saying, the hair college. This nice Korean lady, a student of course, cut me hair for me. It was an interesting experience 'coz she's only been in Australia for a year, so her English wasn't really good. We managed to communicate though. She reminded me of one of those Japanese housewives who you always see in those Jap soap dramas. I was talking to her, and found out she is graduating in December, and from there working at her mother-in-law's salon. Hmmm trying to impress the in-laws?  Well she was cutting it half-way, then her supervisor walked by, this tall hulking guy with bulging biceps, thick veins and a tight t-shirt. He took over for most of the haircut, showing her how to feather-cut my hair using a razor, an advance technique which she hadn't learnt yet. He did a pretty good job - looked nice n layered, and I think made my hair look a lil' finer. (*ahem* he also said I had great hair, and after the cut, he said I looked 'unreal' heheh....oh the praises...). I quite liked it, esp. considering I was afraid to cut too short in case it didn't fit my face shape.  The Korean lady, Jung, was also noting details about my hair in a form as we went along - a pre-requisite for the college I suppose. Flipping through it, I found out my hair is in Good Condition, Porous, and my scalp is Normal (yay, the Selsun Blue 5 for dandruff works!). And all this considering I blow-dry my hair EVERYDAY!  And the price? Are you ready for this? For a wash, cut, half-head highlights, and blow-dry, it's only $55! Fifty-five bucks! Wooohoooo!   Now if only I can get the same results the next time I return to the salon...sigh it always happens. Great the first time, but they can't seem to repeat the same thing the next time round...  After the cut, I went to Priceline and got some hair products - a bottle each of this new Sunsilk Frutrience for Coloured Hair shampoo and conditioner (which also got me a FREE Frutrience cosmetics/vanity bag) and also Wella mousse-wax. I tried the mousse just now, but it didn't have as much hold as I'd like (wanna try some funky upturned flips at the edges of my hair), so I might pop down to Priceline again and get the Styling Mud.  Well, as for tomorrow, I'd better start on that essay that's due on Monday! EEps! And I'll be busy on Saturday afternoon and a lil' on Friday too!! EEK!           "
649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"01,October,2002","               Yummers   Had a very nice night today making really yummy strawberry yoghurt ice-cream. It's sitting in the freezer now, setting, and by tomorrow I should have a delightful dessert! Woopadeedoo!  That said, tomorrow also marks the beginning of essay work, 'coz I've an essay due on Monday. It's the Cont. Hollywood one, which I caught a lucky break - i.e turned out I had 2 extra weeks to do it. Eep. But have I spent the time wisely doing more research? No....Why? 'Coz I deserve a rest dammit! teeheehee...  Oh yes, went down to town today to alter 2 pairs of jeans. One was the Just Jeans one which I bought on Friday, the other a Sportsgirl one which I've been wearing a lil'  sua-ku-ly , i.e. with the hem folded up a huge chunk.   Did you know that alterations can be done and returned on the same day? I didn't! Thought I'd had to wait a couple of days 'coz of all the hemming and tailoring all these people must do. Well, as I found out, JJ has an in-house seamstress who does it on the spot. Unfortunately, she wasn't in today, so I left it to be collected tomorrow.  As for the Sportsgirl one, they send it out to be altered, to a place just across the road called Melbourne Central Tailoring. It was on the 1st Level of an office building, in a tiny little room at the corner. I almost thought I was on the wrong floor 'coz the lift doors opened to reveal a solicitor's office, with its tinted glass windows and couches. It was only after hearing voices from my left, and spying a small rack of blouses hanging near a door that I found the place, run by this really nice n friendly couple. The lady was talking to a Jeans West salesgirl (I figured JW also sent their jeans to be altered there...she was holding a couple of bags), so the man smiled and told me to hold on awhile. Real nice. And the price was right too! After calling several places earlier in the morning, I found out they were the cheapest, charging only $10 (yes, yes, please don't compare to Far East prices ok? If I were back home, I'd have gotten my grandma to do it for me for FREE - she was a seamstress after all). I'd have sent the Just Jeans pair to them too, except for the fact that JJ charges only $5.50 to do their own jeans, with a receipt of purchase of course.  All in all, am quite excited to collect them tomorrow. Yippee-kai-yay!           "
649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"30,November,2002","              Beautiful Collision  She was shy, and looked a little uncomfortable to be on stage for all to see. But her voice was beautiful, enchanting, ephemeral even, as the notes that rolled off her tongue disappeared into the air, like little bubbles of lilting melodies popping in the darkness. She was funny too.  'Is someone smoking pot in here?'  'Did you know that giraffes communicate with each other into ultra-low sonic frequencies? I just saw that on the Discovery Channel. Yeah, 'coz I thought for the last song there where it goes  (sings a low tune) , the giraffes could have done it well.'   The band playing with her were pretty quirky and easy-going too, peppering the performance with comments and laughter. The group was fun to watch, and great to listen to - there was chemistry, and they seemed so relaxed and happy to be on stage, and were so totally devoid of the performance anxiety that grips most background musicians, who generally intensely focus on their playing and ignore the interaction-with-the-audience bit.  After the last song of the set (which was her hit single, Sway, from her debut album 'Drive'), she mimed to the audience that this was the last song, she was going off stage, we were supposed to clap, yell encore, and then she would come out again - hehe, acknowledging the farce that are 'last song' performances, 'coz there's ALWAYS an encore.  Confession: I teared when she sang 'Drive' as part of her encore performance, 'coz, I dunno, it sounded so melancholic, and it reminded me of my sis and how she'd describe the drive-arounds she'd have with Ken, and then I thought of my sis and how I missed her, and I dunno, the whole general atmosphere I suppose. Sigh, whadda wuss I am...  I think I might end up liking her first album more - will go take a listen and see if I'm right.

The gig was worth the 3 1/2 hour wait as 3 opening bands performed (KH came on at 11.55pm!!).  There we were, me and Debbie in the crowd up front as Charles, Jas and Kelly watched from an elevated step. Half the crowd in front of us were jumping up and down, the other half bopping, and the rest behind us watching with cool aloofness, while amidst all this stood two Asian girls head-banging their brains out, arms flailing about, looking like a cross between scarecrows on acid and chickens coming in for a landing. It was WILD. And it was Awesome. And it was pretty short - only about 1 hr long. We wanted MORE!!!  The gig left us on a natural high - Debbs wound the car window down and screamed into the night breeze, scaring the woman in the car next to us at the traffic light, while I just kept smiling and going 'Wooohooo!!'. A bunch of kookies we were. But we had SO much fun, and I haven't done this in a really long time, a couple of years in fact! So it was great to just let go at the gig, especially since we were anonymous beings in a sea of unknown faces. I'm sooooo glad I went, and sooooo glad that Debbie went too, to be my rockin' partner. 'Coz it's not really something you can do alone you know? You need a friend next to you, doing the same wild things, so you won't feel too insecure, even if there is a crowd of people around you.

I was bugging him after dinner to 'be spontaneous' and to 'go somewhere', like the beach or something. 'Coz we never really do anything like that, or go out on dates anymore - usually if it's just the 2 of us it's just running errands together or something. So yeah, had a nice time at St.Kilda Beach, and at the cafe at the end of the pier. We talked and laughed and joked around, and generally had a great time.   Anyways, major event. EG found my keys! We initially thot he'd lost it, and we'd have to cough up money to get a new one requested from the Body Corporate, 'coz it's a security key. But wot a miracle! See, he's been in and out of his car countless times since yesterday night, when he'd thought he'd lost it. He'd driven to church to search, to the post office, and today he drove to church, reparked the car etc. All in all, he was in the car MANY MANY times. And today, after work at the church office, there it was, lying on the seat, in broad daylight, as if someone had just placed it there! Freaky, no? Either someone had somehow gotten into his car, taken the key, made a copy or something, and placed it back there (without stealing the car or breaking any windows...), or a miracle was at work. Touched by an angel eh? They must've been watching.  In other news, got the Bic Runga CD, Beautiful Collision today at JB HiFi, for $18!! Can u imagine? I'd wanted to buy it earlier, so good thing I didn't. I was even in JB HiFi yesterday, but just bought the Killing Heidi album (which I'm really enjoying rite now), figuring since I had an online voucher I could use for the CD. That didn't work out, which was just as well, 'coz today was the start of the JB HiFi Christmas sale! Can anybody say woohooo?  *wooohooo* (echo...echo...echo....)

649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"21,November,2002","              Music makes the people come together...  How would I describe by taste in music?  I say, eclectic. Or in other words,  rojak .  I never really listened to music, other than Christian Praise n Worship growing up, since I was living with parents who thought 'rock music is not edifying to your soul. Why listen to all this trash when you can listen to something good?' Not quite 'rock music is from the devil', though pretty close. But it does make a lotta sense in retrospect I guess.  After discovering that there was alternative Christian music (ie. same genres like rock, dance etc. but with Christian or more sanitised language), I was into that for awhile. Esp. since Jars of Clay was pretty cool.  Then it was Bossa Nova, and all that Jazz.  Now? I dunno. I listen to anything and everything. A bit of Killing Heidi, a little Diana Krall, some Foo Fighters, some John Mayer, a twist of Disco Montego, a dash of Bebel Gilberto and Jobim, some Cafe del Mar series.   Like I said, it's pretty rojak. After a long time trying to figure out my music tastes, I realised I can blend in as easily into a jazz lounge as I can in a mosh-pit (like this Sat. at the KH gig - phew, gonna get me some bruises). Woohooo! I shall not be typecast! I am a unique individual that subscribes to a blend of commercial music! hur hur...  Most underrated band? A New Zealand outfit called  urlLink  Eight  , who came down to S'pore a couple years back. I met the guys, and they were really really nice, and funny too (although a couple of the ones I knew have left since). Their music's really different, so if you get a chance to check 'em out, it'll be great. I personally can't really describe the music, or put it in any category. I call it weird-but-definitely-listenable. They call it rock.   And they're playing for Big Day Out in New Zealand next Jan too! kewl huh? Darn, too bad not in Oz, although NZ is a hop skip and jump away...hmmm...holiday?   PS. Happy Birthday Kenneth!!   21 November 2002             "

I felt like I was back home in Singapore. Except, unfortunately, I do not have the luxury of entering my room to turn on the air-conditioning, because, well, golly gee, I don't have one!  It's sweltering, the heat is intoxicating, stifling, almost as if yr baking in an oven. Even the fan that rotates near your face does not provide a reprieve, except to blast dusty air into your stuffed right nostril (I've got a bit of the flu at the moment). Sigh.  So the nap I took in the afternoon, or rather evening  - woke up about 8pm (and there was still sunlight - I tell you...I'll never get used to this) - left me feeling groggy and more tired than I was before.

It was nice and sunny at Mid Brighton Beach, but way too windy. Overall, it was fabulously delicious, I got some nice piccies of the colourful bathhouses that looked like they could only fit 2 human beings plus their pet turtles - ie. very squishy n small.  Oooh we went to Hunter Gatherer at Acland Street, St. Kilda and picked up a really nice skirt for about $19. Kewl eh? Charles says it makes me look like Jungle Girl, ah but what da hey, you only turn 23 once.   Sigh...23...soon it'll be 25, then 30. How life zooms past. Ever get the feeling?  Anyways, for dinner, EG brought me to this v. nice restaurant by the bay/beach in Williamstown, called Anchorage Restaurant. I had the Sirloin, he had the Eye fillet, even though that place was more of a seafood kinda joint. We ordered the only 2 steaks on the menu. By boy, delicious! And the company was good, although it strayed to topics like 'Is it possible to make drunken fries? Or like flambe it or something...', to which we started enacting how we'd do it, like  (cup hands together)  here's a potato,  (jerk arm as if adding seasoning)  add wine, followed by  (flick thumb as if lighting a cigarette)  lighting it, and then  (move hands together quickly as if imitating a fire that goes fooooooooom)  TA DAAA!!!'  10 mins later....  EG: 'Hey, what are those?' Me: (Chewing a rather large piece of medium-rare steak...)  Cup hands together, jerk arm as if adding seasoning, flick thumb as if lighting a cigarette, move hands together quickly as if imitating a fire that goes fooooooooom  EG: 'Potatoes?' Me:  Excitedly pointing left index finger to nose, and right index finger to EG, nodding vigrously, cheeks full of food   The highlight?  EG: 'Eh? You don't want the mushroom ah?' Me: 'Mushroom? What mushroom?' EG: 'Er...that.' Me: 'It's a mushroom? Oh my goodness! I thought it was a really burnt slice of potato! Like, flambe-d or something!'  Yes, my blonde roots were showing.  My parents called later, to wish me a Happy Birthday, as well as my sis this morning. Tho Thweet. And Bart too, half and hour ago (Note to Bart: It's OK!!

So far I've gotten a really cool laptop backpack for my luverly iBook from EG, Charles and Wally, and very adorable Sabi underwear from Bel. It's blue striped with a goldfish in front - she was very excited about it hehe. (Although Charles insists it isn't a goldfish, it's just a fish that's orange-gold in colour. Looking at it, yeah, maybe, but me and Bel will insist it is a goldfish! For my (name)sake!)  We're going for a picnic at Brighton Beach later, and a nice dinner, just me n EG later tonight. Can't wait.   How we decided on Brighton Beach was really amazing! We were scratching our heads as to where to go for a nice picnic. So I thot, hmm, somwhere not too far out, but still away from the city. Maybe a beach, or the countryside. Figured, hey, we've passed Brighton beach a coupla times on our way to Ikea in Moorabin, why not give it a go? I still wasn't sure though...  Then EG came home, so I asked him, 'Where should we go?'  'How about Brighton Beach?' I stared at him, while scrambling to find in my brain whether i'd mention the location to him earlier on the phone or icq or something. Nope-didn't.  'You're kidding! I thot of it too! Oh my gosh!' 'Yeah, Shawn's been there once, siad it was pretty good.' 'Oh my gosh! It's a sign I tell you! I even asked Evie about it just now. Maybe God wants us to be there or something...heheh'  Hmm..maybe he does? We'll see. It's amazing how excited I get about the lil' things in life...very easily amused hehe...  Okely dokelies.

'Oh, Singapore isn't very big, it's actually smaller than Victoria...we don't really have states.'  Yes, yes, such are the pearls of wisdom that spewed from my mouth at an alarming rate at the staff meeting. I really hope people didn't leave thinking 'god, that weird Chinese girl talks waaaay too much'.  'Coz that's what I think I did.

The other staff pple were nice, and so was the meal, at Kun Ming Restaurant at Lt. Bourke St. It's been there for ages apparently, and got a huge do-up recently, leaving it looking pretty posh. Other than my inanities, it was mostly coffee talk.  I don't think I'll get as many hours as I'd like to work, judging by the training schedule. So won't make as much I guess. But I have a good vibe about the job...the boss, the pple, the place, the uniforms (which me Boss has to re-order 'coz they were a lil' too big). They're also pretty strict about attire - no earrings, minimal jewellry etc. Oh wells, not that I have any outstanding piercings anyways...And praise God, the job's starting 1 week later than scheduled, on Dec 9, so that means I get to go Church Camp! Woopee! (woopee mostly 'coz I get to surf hehe....)  Anyways, those were the highlights. Hope things work out with colleagues!

Just returned from the movie - it wasn't too bad, albeit a lil' predictable towards the end. Does anyone know if the ending was the same as the book? Kenneth believes its different - shan't say more or I'll be accused of being a 'spoiler'.  Anyways, just thot some areas could be developed more, like the relationship between Reba and Francis (aka Mr D. aka Red Dragon aka Psychotically Repressed And Emotionally Abused Serial Killer). Stellar performance from Mr. Hopkins . Wasn't much space for Edward Norton to strut his stuff though. Same goes for Ray Fiennes. Emily Watson was very convincing as Reba, the blinking kewpie doll.   That aside, I also went to Borders and almost bought a book - 'White Teeth' by Zadie Smith (was it Smith?), although was stopped at the last minute by Shawn who said it sucked. He said he was willing to give me his copy, which was back in Singapore though. Damn...  I spent a good 20 mins trying to finish reading  the Glamour mag that I'd started the last time I was at Borders. At $11 a pop, I don't have the moola to spend on buying imported mags, so it's Border's free browsing for me. Never got to the last page, but did read an interesting article by Kristen Gore Schiff (Al and Tipper's daughter btw) regarding women, work and motherhood, and why can't women have it all without compromise. I'll prob. read it again, to relook at the fine points she brought up. Did you know that Australia and America are the only two developed countries which have UNPAID maternity leave? tsk tsk....UK has 18 days while Hungary has 24!  A couple months back there was a huge hoo-haa regarding a bill that a women's coalition was trying to pass, that they get to have up to 3 years maternity leave. Some said it wasn't economical to keep a woman at the company and have her retrained when she returned. Me? I'm not quite sure where my stand is, 'coz I don't enough about the properties of the bill, nor do I know how much maternity is enough, nor do I know what the so-called economic costs are. So, gotta find out so I can weigh out the costs, and see where I stand.  I do believe, however, that the company she works for should be supportive, and allow her enough time to spend with her child, and not penalise her in monetary terms. In short, motherhood/household maintenance etc. is work!   I wonder if anyone's written a thesis about the whole leave-the-nursing-to-the-maids issue in Asia. How does that affect a woman's stand and her power relations with men and other women? Other than the gender issue, it also becomes somewhat of a class issue too.  Any thots?

After years of thinking such people as   le poseur , I've come to the conclusion that we can't help but do so as a natural human effort to communicate with others clearly. I.e. if we speak a lil' like 'em, they'll understand us a whole lot betta.  Case in point: A couple of weeks ago I was checking around for prices for belly-piercing - Bel wanted to give it a go, so I was sourcing for the costs. Ended up calling this guy, who turned out to be a pharmacist who did all sorta piercings for pple, along with his wife who was a doctor (hygiene!). I rang up, and somehow ended up with a twang as I spoke. This usually pops up when I'm a lil' nervous too - lapsing into my Valley girl mode.   Hi, I'm just wondering if you guys like, do belly-piercing?    Yep, we sure do.     Oh, how much does it cah-st?    Well, it's $75, but it's pretty cheap. You sound like you're from America.   Momentararily caught off-guard, I said the first thing that popped into my head to explain the accent.   Uh, yeah, I am.    Oh, which part?    Sawrry?    I mean where are you from?    Erm, America? But I'm in Melbourne now....    Oh, erm, er, that's all right, heh. I was trained in San Francisco myself, so I know that you're getting a good price here. Are you a Melbourne Uni student?     Erm yeah, I'm an...exchange student.    Well, Melbourne Uni students get a discount, so that's about (calculate calculate calculate) $63.    Oh cool, ok.

Added to that I'd injured the middle finger on my right hand just minutes before the race playing air hockey. Sigh - the injuries from my go-karting expedition happened b4 the race'd even started!  But going at pedel-to-the-metal speed on the straightest part of the track was such a scary experience. Some people call it a speed rush; me, I call it time to pray. I think it was scary 'coz the turns came up too soon - didn't get to enjpy the speed of that stretch b4 having to tap the brakes and make the turn without skidding. And when someone crashed into me, boy was it painful - lurched forward in my seat.   I hate having other drivers really tagging close to me too - so I just give way. See? Whadda wuss haha.... :-) I guess that'll make me a semi-safe driver in real life (which reminds me, EG's supposed to teach me next week. Woohoo!) Anyways, I think I'll try the other track up in Sunshine soon - the Port Melbourne one, in a converted warehouse, just seems too small. Oh, and with a smaller group, so I don't have to keep slowing down when the amber lights start flashing 'coz someone's just crashed.                "

649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"21,January,2003","              Intense  That was the expression on Eminem's face in 8 Mile. Either that or Intense-stoned. The only 2 expressions captured on camera thoughout the movie. Oh yeah, and when he gets pissed off - then that's Beat-the-shit-outta-you-Intense.     Phew!  The pic was pretty all right - very character-driven, although it tended to drag a bit. Parts I liked? The scene where he raps/sings to 'Sweet Home Alabama', in his words of course. Also the touching couple of minutes when he's tucking his younger sis (or daughter? the movie's pretty vague about it) into bed and sings her to sleep. (Side note though; Emmy, baby, stick to da yo-ho-ho-rap n leave da singin' to da professionals, ya know what I'm sayin', bro?). Oh and the mandatory shag scene, I'd like to think, was thrown in for good measure just to prove a) he digs Britney Murphy's character, Alex,  b) to show how trite and meaningless sex is today, and c) just to please the bulk of the movie's audience made up of adolescents wanting to Be Like Em, who are up for some gratituous shots of flesh, esp. Murphy's (although let's not forget the scene where he flashes a piece of his lily-white ass to the audience as part of the Rap Battle Royale sequence at the end).  That said, with those intense close-ups of Emmy's face, I think he's actually kinda cute. Symmetrical features, piercing blue eyes. In fact, he could down right be a nice sweet ol' guy. He's a romantic, a passionate poet at heart, his melodic lyrics inspiring this shattered world to greater heights. Save for the parts where he wants to kill his ex-wife of course.              "

She popped it into her bag, and when she finally picked up the phone after I'd rung it countless times upon discovering its disappearance, I was overcome with joy. Praise God. What a miracle. Considering the fact that she had no idea how to operate a mobile phone.  After a long while trying to figure out where she lived (her English wasn't very good - I think she's Italian), and after calling Charles countless times, and after rearranging my meeting with Bridget, I was finally off to Ardeer to meet this lovely angel who rescued my blood-line, my mobile phone. Where all my contacts (and the free pass-SMS to 'Chicago') were stored.   Mac opened the gate and returned the phone to me, to which I gave her an impulsive hug, so relieved I was. Phew.

649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"06,January,2003","              Bleepin' Fooo   *Parental Guidance advised. This post contains explicit language (which serves to highlight the reality of the situation).*  Today's rude awakening was brought to you by a scruffy pudgy jerk who wouldn't know his right hand from a can of VB if he didn't occasionally have to pick his nose.  There we were, standing on the curb waiting to cross the road like law-abiding pedestrians when a few jaywalkers crossed over to our side. Since there wasn't much room curbside with the crowd waiting for the lights to change, two of them had to squeeze past in the space between me and the shop that sold motorbikes on Elizabeth and A'Beckett.  The third brusqely shoved past me and bumped me aside, then had the audacity to blame me for not moving to accomodate his pudginess.  'Hey!' I said when I felt the push.   'Stupid fucking chink' he said at the same time, as he walked on.  I was stunned, then ranted to Shawn and Charles, 'What an asshole!'  Shawn shouted to the guy's retreating back 'Hey what's the matter with you?'  The Pudge turned around. 'She didn't move outta the way.'  'And that gives you the right to be rude? Have some manners, man' Shawn replied before turning around.  The Pudge advanced towards us enacting acts of bravado you see only on TV, spewing cliches less cornball than 'you wanna piece o' me', and more cheesy than 'bring it on'. Something more akin to the Far East Plaza bengs' call-to-arms of 'Settle!!' while flashing an orange comb with a pointy end.   Shawn turned around and faced him, once again reprimanding him for being rude, as the Pudge defended himself, eloquently stating 'So what?'  'Hey, you were the one that bumped into me ok?' I said. I was ignored.  There they were, two male peacocks in all their fiery glory, fighting for a piece of lost pride, jaws squared, looking at each other straight in the eye, the space between them the width of two fingers.  And I was thinking, where am I in all of this? This isn't some bullshit attention-seeking rant that I'm spouting here, but seriously, if he had a problem, didn't he have it with me as well? After all, wasn't I the stupid fucking chink that got into his Royal Pudginess' way? Did I need Shawn to defend my honour like a frail damsel in distress? Do I need to reminded, even now, that I would have slunk away muttering angrily before the shock of it wore off and I realised I should have retaliated? Or maybe I would have just turned the other cheek, saying I shouldn't bother or sink to their level (and used it as an excuse to hide my fear as I'm wont to do sometimes)?  Shawn just reminded me of the time at Priceline when this skinny bleached blonde teen just stepped on my heels and when I exclaimed 'Ow' she just told me to move my bags from the bench, and all I did was mutter 'Bitch' UNDER MY BREATH. He says we shouldn't let people like this get away with it.  So what should I do? I don't just go quietly, which I used to do last time; now at least I show my disapproval at others' rudeness. But what about setting an example? WWJD? Dammit, sometimes I know what I can do, maybe shout back a cheerful 'thank you for being so niiiice', and 'God loves you'  (and also just to unnerve them), but a scathing comeback's so much easier to take on than love and peace or even a conciliatory nod of 'whatever'. And maybe I just DON'T want to be nice or submissive. Maybe I want to fight my own battles, and show that I can hold my own against the Rude Ones, men or women (but especially men).  As the brilliant plumage of the peacocks began to fold back, Shawn decided to turn around and walk off leaving the Pudge to continue ranting, 'hey we can do this right now, man. Come on...' The Pudge just fudged his battle.  Charles asked what was it the guy had said that sparked the whole episode, and as Shawn replied, a young Aussie couple walking by us told us just to 'ignore that jerk. He doesn't know what he's talking about and unfortunately some Australians are just idiots. Not all of us like that'   We smiled, 'yeah, that's good to know. Thanks'. They smiled back, kindred spirits for awhile.  It takes all kinds, doesn't it? But what do I know? I'm the Other - a  Woman  of  Asian  descent, a small speck in this (post-colonialist patriarchal) world. [Forgive me for indulging in that piece of arty-farty knowledge hehe]  If my primary five teacher Mrs Koh were here, she'd have given him a stern talking to, and washed his mouth out with Dynamo for using such filthy language. That's what we need to keep the streets clean. A stout middle-aged aunty who could hold her own against the young punks of today.   Try calling  her  a stupid effin' chink.    5 January 2003           "

And lanterns...yes, even though lanterns are more for Mooncake/Lantern festival, but hey, it's still Chinese-y eh?  A funny story I heard today btw. A group of the people from church were in Chinatown, enjoying the festivities, when one of them got handed a booklet containing some facts and info about Asian businesses in Chinatown. She rejected it though, saying 'I'm not Asian!' under her breath. Thing is, she's Chinese! But she doesn't consider herself one I suppose. A couple of Aussies there heard it too, then smiled.  I wonder, why do 2nd-generation Asians sometimes deny their heritage? It's a whole issue I've been reading about for class, the diasporic community in a new homeland, and how the kids adjust being part of both worlds. About 95% of the people in my church are Asians, a good number being Aussie-born Asians. I wonder how they really see themselves; most don't speak Mandarin, some occasionally follow their parents to visit relatives back home in S'pore or M'sia, and a lot don't know a large part of their cultural heritage. Few of the Asian-Aussies turned up for the CNY picnic today - most were the Intn'l students, and the adults.  I guess now I'm beginning to appreciate and value the education I had growing up, being forced to learn Mandarin for 11 years ('O' and 'AO'-level Chinese). Some of it really sticks to your brain yah? I guess if I end up settling down in a country where my Mother Tongue isn't widely spoken, or part of the curriculum, I'd also send my kids to Chinese School, just to learn a bit of their heritage, language and culture, something extremely important (and marketable!) in this global age.

Woohooo!  I called me mum yesterday to talk, and yet again it turned into another session contemplating her worry over my brothers' future. Seems like the older one's acting up again, understandable seeing how he's going through the teenage angst years, but he's more difficult than she's imagined it to be, and she's worried over the company he's been mixing with, who've recently been caught shoplifting. Stealing for the Winona Ryder-esque thrill of it. And we're talking about a pack of rich spoilt boys from his school here. Bored rich kids who don't understand the value of money, who bandy about their fathers' wealth like a troupe of marauding monkeys, sucking up innocents who wish they could be like them, like my brother. Maybe I'm being judgemental here, but I honestly don't care, just wish my bro would wise up. Sigh, the  financial situation back home is really taking a toll on everyone.  I'm hoping to apply for a bursary from school to help with living expenses, at least till I graduate. I missed the boat on the rent one, which subsidises about $60 a week, but hopefully  there are others I can apply for. It's no-strings-attached, so prayerfully, that'll work out somewhat, to alleviate the financial burden on my parents.   It's quite pathetic how I keep running to God only when I'm in trouble or worried, however understandle it is, being a part of human nature. Yet sometimes I wish I could find the passion I once had about church and reading his Word, yet am bogged down by the mundaneness of life such that I can't find a reason to, or more appropriately face the inertia of picking up my Bible to read and meditate.  Although I see myself reaching out some way, in my little human form, for that vast expanse that is 'spirituality' and 'passion for God' yet coming up short most times.   Is it the engagement of the topic however? Does the deliverer of the sermon exist to entertain or educate? We (and I say we in the broadest sense 'coz I think most of us tune out once in awhile) learn when we're receptive and humour creates such an environment. How much then, do we learn when we switch off or don't connect with the speaker sometimes? But beside the Sunday agenda, there's more work to do to, on a daily basis, building such a close relationship, which to be honest, makes me wish I could have a proper conversation with God - as in hear audibly and see physically. Are real relationships based on this? The seeing and hearing and touching and feeling? The tangibility of the other?  Ah wells...back to my little worm hole I guess...         "

So there they were, chatting and laughing and joking around, needlessly wasting time, indecisively deciding where to lunch.

I remember the times us kids spent in the queen-sized bed he shared with Mum, playing 'I Spy with my Little Eye' as he picked out easy items within plain sight, while we picked out items that couldn't possibly be hard to guess, yet he humoured us, and tried multiple times before we laughingly yelled out 'No Pa! It's the TV lah!'  I remember how he used to purse his lips together whenever he got mad, a stern warning to stop being naughty before he brandished the dreaded cane. But I also remember how he restrained from lashing out when he saw my terrible A-level results, and how he tolerated my first serious boyfriend even though he knew that guy was never right for me. And how he embraced the next, now my fiance, into the warm folds of our family.  For all this, I say, Thank You Dad, for being the head of our household, for being inspiring and uplifting, for being the earthly image of our Father up above. Thank you for caring, thank you for loving, and thank you for leading me in my life. God bless, and I love you.            "

Sometimes I question my calling in this ministry, this field. Where do I truly fit in, in all of this, in the ever-changing environment that I've been planted in? A lot of issues on self-worth and -centredness get thrown up in the mix, and I have to keep reminding myself that there's a greater purpose involved and at stake.

So sings glam-rock bad-boy has-been 'Billy Mack' in the opening sequence of 'Love Actually'.  And he sings it so, so well - the ol' geezer, gyrating to the rhythm. But he's not the only one to gyrate (or vibrate, or translate, or prostrate) in the movie, no. For 'tis the season to be jolly, and Love, Actually, packs a punch!  The movie was hilarious! Tho' the plot intricately weaving through various (love)-lives was predictably naff, understated British humour never ceases to make me laugh till my belly aches. I'd expect nothing less from Richard Curtis, the man who brought us Bridget Jones' Diary, Mr Bean, and the Black Adder series. (And yes, Rowan Atkinson does make a couple appearances).  Truth be told, the movie should really be titled 'Lust Actually', or 'Luff Actually'. It charts the fluff-luff lives of several characters in present-day Christmas season London. It's love-at-first-sight. Or love-and-sex-at-second-sight. And where it comes close to the true meaning of Love -  choosing  to love, each day, again and again, despite mistakes and close encounters with infidelity - it shies away, preferring to gloss over its painful reality in favour of the 'sweet pure agony of being  in  love'.  One of the perks the movie offers is the fact that you'd recognise most of the faces in the movie, including Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth (Bridget Jones'), Alan Rickman (the bad dude in Harry Potter), Kiera Knightley (Bend it like Beckham, Pirates of the Caribbean) and Hugh Grant as  (can you believe it?)  the British Prime Minister!!

649790,female,24,indUnk,Scorpio,"29,December,2003","              Ponder  I've just finished a book by Francine Rivers called 'And the Shofar Blew'. It's a very real, telling, tale of the lives lead by a Pastor and his wife, called to serve a local community when the church's pastor retires. The book weaves intricately, and into depth, of the anguish the wife faces as her marriage disintegrates while her husband presses forward in building his ministry, into growing a church that he hopes would please his dad, the respected leader of a well-known mega-church.  It's not a plot-driven book. The climax is almost predictable, and the pace tends to dawdle at times. But the attention to emotional detail is amazing, and you feel and cry and smile as the characters do, while facing their daily demons.   I expected to turn the last page and sigh with a breath of contentment, of longing, that the journey I'd begun had ended all too shortly. But surprisingly, it left me cold. A cool splash to wake me up, to alert me to the dangers of ambition getting in the way of ministry, of being blinded by personal goals with no regard for wise counsel. Are we building projects too fast, steamrolling whatever (or whoever) gets in the way of progress? Am I constantly listening to the Spirit's guidance? Is this what the Lord wants? These questions were whirring through my head as I finished the last chapter.  And I have no answers. Not yet anyways. And I'm glad for reading that book - not just due to its entertainment factor - but for the fact that it got me thinking. And to dwell on thoughts that challenge my approach to ministry, my calling (which may throw doubts in the face of faith - always an unpopular approach). To think of what I'm doing, and how it ties in with the Purpose of My life, and to think about why I choose to do what I do; why I work on the projects I do right now; whether I'm going along with the flow 'coz it's my job; do I truly believe what I say I should believe in for 2004?  Questions questions questions.   It's good, I think. At least I'm thinking, and not following along like a blind herded sheep. The answers, I believe, lie somewhere along the lines of dying to my Self - the Self that's lazy, unmotivated, procrastinating, happy to coast along with whatever life throws at me. And I  know  that's not how life should be; rolling with the punches, drifting from pleasure to pain and back again. There's more!  Wake up Sparky!!             "

Even friends have pointed it out, although a part of me is still reluctant to accept that I have changed, and for the better too. I'm more passionate, more vocal, feeling the zest to be close to God. (Yet strangely hypocritical 'coz I havent' been reading my Bible or spending time praying as much as I should. And it's not for anyone's, or God's sake that I do it mind you, it's really for my own. Tsk...the angst of procrastination....)  To wit, I say, onward Christian soldier!            "

Last Saturday, invited some old friends for CNY dinner including Egene's parents, Uncle Thomsas & Aunty Rosemary. Half way thru dinner, I tried to switch on the TV to watch the Chingay Procession 'live' but can't get it. I was asking them 'Hey, Chingay what time huh?'  Then, Uncle Tom and Auntie Rose started to look at their watches to tell me the current time.   One old friend shouted 'Oi, you asking your 'chingay' what is the time or you asking 'what time will be chingay be on?'   Then I realise Egene's parents thought I was calling to them as 'ching-gay' in Hokkien, which means 'in-laws'.  hahahah so funny...... Luv, MUm'   All I can say is, OH... MY... GAWD.....          "

So a quick recap:  1. Just returned from a whirlwind tour of Bangkok & Koh Samui, and HOME sweet HOME! 2. Now back in Melbourne, freezing in our cold 'summer' weather. 3. Over-indulged in CNY goodies over the past couple of weeks.  4. Gained extra kilos 'coz of said CNY goodies. 5. Does anyone know how to make  more  CNY goodies? 6. New roles at job. :) 7. Just watched Honey - am inspired once again (though not by the stilted acting) to 'shake my tailfeather'. 8. Thinking of taking dance class so I 'booty to the beat, 'yo' like Jessica Alba in Honey (and to lose said CNY kilos). 9. Thinking of volunteering at local campus radio station to 'get back into the game'. 10. Should really stop annoying habit of speaking in 'quotation marks'.  Also, I confess, in my MTV-fuelled madness while back home, I bought 'In The Zone' (simply because  I can  and  I like her ok? ). Needless to say, my friends have disowned me, my brothers loathe me, and my pet fish and I are no longer on speaking terms.  Sigh.   ;)             "

And reminded me of the anguish of assignments etc, and having my  sacre bleau!!  iBook damaged. Those were the days.  Thankfully Azalea, my trusty iBook has served me well in the last 3 years. Only the battery's shot, 'coz of the 'overcharging' I did to her. Basically, Azalea functions more as a desktop rather than a laptop nowadays...but she's still pretty!

Very showy, but what would you expect from a song to the tune of Copacabana?!  Imagine...a darkened theatre, a solitary spotlight focussed onstage, where a lone figure sits on a barstool, her head bowed down, capped by a black fedora. The tune plays over the sound system, and on cue, I pop my head up and start singing, softly at first, then louder and louder and joined in by the bopping chorus behind me, while the dancers carry the life-sized illustrations as they prance about on stage as the sounds cultimates to its dramatic climax and..and...and...

So much to get done! And so many people to liaise with.  Sometimes, I wonder if it's just easier to  NOT  work with people, especially when u have to push, cajole, beg to ask them to get things done. I hate doing it, hate being the middleman. I want the Vision to inspire people enough that they're clamouring to get it done, to support what we're planning, but those darn  exams  just get in the way!!  Planning a wedding, on the flipside, seems to generate much more excitement. Most people ar ecstatic to be invited to be part of the intimate undertakings of planning a wedding! And I fully understand why - it's like being a part of a secret sorority that creates something beautiful, and once-in-a-lifetime chance! And I'm so terribly honoured and grateful that my friends have jumped at the chance to assist and be a part of something that holds so much meaning to me.   I guess I just wish that that sort of excitement could be generated in everything I need help to do! Is it really how well I have to cast a Vision that'll inspire others to move out of their comfort zones? Sometimes even I don't want to move out of the zone myself, to do above and beyond what's just required of me. I mean it's not like I need/want others to do the tasks - but really the sense of delegation-as-empowerment. As in 'teach them how to fish, and they can fish for a lifetime', that kinda philosophy! (But of course, there are instances where my skills are sorely deprived in departments of creative design, graphics and layout, and I have to depend on others.)  As you can tell I'm ranting. Lord, I ask for wisdom and strength and calmness in times like these! Teach me to be more like you! Less Self, more You!!  Father, I need your supreme wisdom, patience and kindness to fill my every thought and deed. Let me not be so tired that I forget how to see others as images of You!          "

BUt mostly, it was the time spent after that we engaged with the creative side of our minds as we prepared for our song-and-dance bunch item for the upcoming annual dinner.  In the words of Bob the Tomato, 'have we got a show for you!!'  Suffice to say, we're ripping off showtunes and putting our own words in it. They're songs that kids would appreciate I presume, not least for the fact they're composed by a bunch of adults with very kid-like mentalities.

Which also marks the 9th month mark of my term as an Intern at ACCF!!  (applause applause)   Today's BIG QUESTION:  What does it mean to live a life that's  adventurously expectant ?   Romans 8:15 [MSG]: The resurrection life you received from God is not a timid, grave-tending life. It's adventurously expectant, greeting God with a childlike, 'what's next, Papa'?   I guess for me, a life that's lived adventurously is one that's on the edge (however cliche that sounds!), built in faith. Expectancy calls for faith, calls for living beyond what we can see and often times beyond our means or capabilities. Adventurously - that's a call to be daring, to leave our comfort zones.  So today, I shall begin like this: I adventurously expect...  Post your adventurous expectancies, people! (in the comments section)              "

It's like playing word association, where each phrase conjures up an expanse of images and feelings and heightened senses.    These are the words for me: Aunty Yvonne CNY Angpow Chicken Wings Wedding Funeral Life Support Heart Lung Breath Cancer Crash Distant Close Love Home Tim Danny Adeline Daisy Telok Blangah Short hair Maternal Peace Heaven Love  I wonder if any of these memories are simply confabulations, stop-gaps to create a sense of connection, like I'm grasping bits of straw that inevitably slip through my weak fingers.   I don't know what to feel, and I'd gather most in my situation wouldn't as well. Sad, yes but yet, at times, not really. It's only when triggers appear, or when I'm not distracted by something else, work, people, church. Like I'm trying every emotion in the spectrum for size, to see how it fits. Do I grieve? Yes I guess, where the wracking sobs appear inexplicably, but not very long each time, and anyways, just what are the rules for the mourning process? So new, this is. So very new.  I wonder if my Grandma realises what's happened. And I wonder what that would trigger in her too - will she babble and smile, and greet familiar faces at the wake, not comprehending its significance? Or worse, understand the full painful  measure of the loss of a child?  Too many thoughts to ponder...         "

I got a frantic SMS from my mum today, read it disbelievingly, then called her back immediately, only to hear the distress in her voice. She sounded like she'd be crying, and rightly so I suppose. We just found out my closest Aunt, on my Dad's side, has been declared (and I  HATE this word) brain-dead. Brain-dead. Almost a cliche. Like a sufficiently melodramatic phenomena constantly portrayed in a daytime soap opera or Channel 8 serial.  She's on life support right now, and I don't have the full details, but suffice to say, I'm shocked. I had no idea this was coming. Her cancer's been in remission for awhile, and I'd never known that she'd been in-and-out of the hospital over the last couple of months. This was sudden. Bringing up her name always conjured up images of love, warmth, and fantastic food that we'd always enjoy at her place during CNY. And though we only ever saw each other during my trips home in the Lunar New Year period, we've maintained a certain sense of closeness, I feel. I'd anticipated meeting up sometime during my trip back in December (even during CNY again if possible), or if not, at the wedding in April, but now...  I don't know what I feel. Close, yet distant. Worried, anxious, helpless, yet...not quite believing it. Not quite coming to terms. Maybe my mum's message was wrong. Maybe it was a 'she  might  be brain-dead' kinda thing - mum often leans towards theatrics, it run in my family.  We'll just have to wait and see. Maybe I'm wrong. Hopefully. Prayerfully.

I suddenly feel like I'm being extremely unproductive. Lots to do - but it's all a blur of tasks that I'm not quite up to doing. It's all the planning I have to do - hate sitting at a desk, interacting with a voiceless machine, and trying to articulate the swim of thoughts and things-that-need-to-be-done in point form. Am expected to plan and strategise. but am neither equipped nor have the passion to do so! I totally dislike a desk-bound job.

Altho' of course, a huge part is so I won't disappoint the people who expect me to be there - BUT!

Of the lossness of memory, of being a prisoner of self, of the fading distance between the conscious mind and the unconscious one. The reminder served to halt all trains of thought and brought great, sobbing tears to my eyes. Will I see her when I return in December? Will she live long enough to celebrate my impending marriage? Will she be there, waiting on the front porch, smiling through the haze of her cloudy vision?  I wrote this in response, to that reminder:  'I'm crying at work. Sobbing in fact. Mostly due to the feeling of abject horror and loss, a total and overwhelming sense of helplessness, and guilt. Oh the guilt. That I can't even give her a hug when I most want to, that she has totally recessed from my conscious mind, only to turn up as a blip in my radar when her name is mentioned.  But yet I understand the passage of life, the frailty and fruitlessness of the achievements made in decades past, fading as distant drops in the misty horizon. Which is why I'm reminded once again, that I cannot live it the way most do, climbing, clawing, attaining and ultimately losing, everything. And I'm cheered, and conforted, by the fact that she's as much an eternal being as me and you; her body and mind will disappear, but her soul, bouyed by her faith and belief in her Saviour, will never cease to exist.'  To the person who reminded me, I hope you understand, too. Not because I seem to know the answer, and that this is the only answer, but it's my source of comfort and strength.  He  is.

3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       Every morning when I wake up I think, 'This, this is the day that I will go to bed early!'  I hate getting up in the morning.  I am so not a morning person that I am the anti-morning person.  If you talk to me as I am waking, I will growl at you, even if you are being ever so sweet and tying to gently rouse me.  I crave Saturdays when there are no waking up deadlines and sleep goes on and on and on.  But, somehow, and micraculously, after about 15-20 minutes on the weekdays, I begin to perk up, start making the coffee (thank God for coffee) and think that maybe I can make it through the day without vertically snoring.  I do end up making it through the day, but have to fight like hell not to take a nap in the afternoon.  The hours between 4-6 have become my nemisis.  The problem revolves around the fact that I stay up 'til about 12:30 or 1 everynight (I teach school so this is way late).  There is no real reason why I do this.  I am not writing a novel or developing photographs or even knitting an amazing sweater.  No, you can usually catch me doing, well, nothing I guess.  I can't acurately say what I do each night.  Sometimes I'm reading, sometimes watching TV, sometimes reading blogs online, and sometimes talking to west coast friends.  I used to actually stay up to watch Letterman, but TV bores me more and more lately.    I have always been a night owl.  I can't remember when I didn't like staying up late.  It must have started in late elmentary school or middle school when I can remember watching Saturday Night Live and Johnny Carson with my family (I know, quality bonding time).  I remember in college wishing that exams were given at night because my brain was just so much more alert then and I was convinced this would improve my grades.  I still 'wake up' at about 8pm everynight.  This is when I begin getting things done, the dishes, the laundry, the phone calls, the emails, the projects, the organizing.  About 2 hours into my second wind, I remember that I wanted to go to bed early so I don't feel like shit in the morning, but 10pm rolls around and I think I can give it one more hour and then I think if I go to bed at midnight I'll still get about 7 and 1/2 hours of sleep.  Sounds good, but this never happens.  So, everynight I stay up doing things that will sadly not bring to me to enlightenment anytime soon.  I wish that I could say that I have an extraordinary social life filled with late night gallery openings and wild parties, but no.  That's not me anyway.  Instead, I'll be washing my hair, helping my friends pick the perfect bridesmaids dress online or shutting the world out with a book.  Tonight I will be, um, let's see, um, well, how about reading my fabulous travel book on London (no, I'm not going anytime soon, I'm just obsessed) until midnight.  And tomorrow morning when I wake up I will think 'This, this is the day that I will go to bed early!'         "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       Who, pray tell, designed apartment buildings so that you can hear everything that is happening in the apartment below you with almost complete and utter accuracy?  I mean, is it that hard to place some sound absorbing panels in between the floors as you build?  Think, architects, think!    My neighbors downstairs are college students.  Why they live in our beautiful, mostly populated by the elderly and some young professionals, far away from the college they attend apartment complex, I don't know.  And, I actually, don't know them.  I know that one is a boy and one is a girl.  I know that the boy plays guitar and sometimes tries to sing along, mostly Dave Matthews songs.  I know the girl will occasionally put on some Jason Mraz.  (My connections to the above musicians would probably blow their minds, but I will never be friends with these college brats and so they will never know.)  And, I know that I can hear the boy cough at times.  What does that mean he can hear me do?  I wonder about this one.  Tonight, they are listening to the radio and they have what I think is a subwoofer cranked up so as I sit here trying to watch TV or listen to my music, I just hear deep voices and bass.  It BLOWS!!!!!!!!!  So, being the oh so nice and always ready to lend you some sugar should you be baking something neighbor, I turned up my subwoofer to the MAXIMUM.  Take that you slackers!  I am usually quite kind with my subwoofer.  When my brother installed it and put it at Maximum, I told him I had neighbors below and that it needed to go lower, a lot lower.  So much for thinking of other people.   The reason for this retaliation is that I think that they like to bang their ceiling, my floor, when they think that I am being loud.  I am not loud.  OK, so I always have some kind of noise on, I hate quiet, but when I am watching TV and they bang, and I check the volume, it is on 2 bars.  'OK people, I pay enough in rent to listen to my TV at 2 FUCKING BARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'  I am not actually sure what the banging is about.  I wonder sometimes if it is my imagination.  What could 2-3 pounding-like sounds in rapid succession be?  One day I came home and as I walked in the door I heard the 2 bangs.  I threw my stuff down and yelled at the floor 'I haven't even been here to make noise.  What, you don't like it when I open my door?'    Maybe, just maybe, there is some phantom mouse running around and driving them crazy while I am constantly monitoring my volume.  I can't help but remember the Friends episode where the old neighbor below is always banging on his ceiling when the friends are not actually making noise.  When he dies and they go to his apartment they hear what sounds like a party going on above them, but they are all in his apartment. Could this be what is happening in my building? I don't know, but I always turn down the noise if I hear the banging until, of course, tonight and the subwoofer wars.  Game on!           "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       Richmond's annual chili cook-off held many feasts for my eyes:  1) William Hung.  I know, you're jealous.  He was one act among many at the festivities and his one song performance of 'She Bangs' was almost worth the $20 admission fee.  2) People wearing clothes that should have been retired years ago (or never purchased)- a) Belly shirts- these should only be worn by people who do not actually have bellies and then only when they want other women to hate them. b) Clothing that is too tight- there was a woman who looked normal in everyway except that her tan linen pants were a bit snug above her thighs, and by snug I mean she had a perma-wedgie. c) Stripper shoes- The shoes which I am referring to had a 3 inch clear plastic heel, silver souls, and clear plastic straps.  I know, you're jealous again.  Note to self- don't go to the chili cook-off as can't handle the dress requirements.  3) People running after beer- the beer trucks ran out of beer about an hour before the cook-off ended.  We were waiting in line and when they would announce that the beer was gone people would scatter quickly to another truck, and so on, and so on.  Note to self- don't go to an event where grown people run after silly things, unless there is a sale on at Saks.  4) A woman's bare ass- as I walked to my car I saw that the passenger door of the car beside me was open, blocking my door.  There was no one around and as I got closer and closer I looked for someone to tell that I needed to close the door.  Then, as I approached my car I saw that there was in fact someone behind the door, a woman's bare ass peeing.  Um, OK, um, um, look in the other direction, um, wait, um, don't look, hope that friend tells her I am here, um, um.  When she is done and is pulling up her pants over her bare ass and says 'I'm sorry, I just really had to pee,' say 'It's OK, do what you gotta do' and quickly get in your car and pull away.  Note to self- never, never have to pee that bad.            "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       When I checked the mail one day last week and saw the oversized, cream envelope with my name and address perfectly printed on it, I thought 'Oh hell, here's another one.'  I open it to find an invitation to a cousin's wedding in May.  As I scan the card for the wedding, the reception, the directions, and the reply card I think, 'And so the season begins.'  Every year there is a flow of weddings in my life.  I have probably been to at least 50 weddings since I was small.  Since college, they just keep on coming.  Someone told me that there is usually a boom right after college and then again in your 30s.  Um, there has been no let up in the bombing, apparently the troops refuse to surrender, give up and just go home.  I do have to say that I sometimes, am on the firing squad, well in some capacity anyway.  This year marks the seventh run as a bridesmaid for me  (OK, so 2 of them were my brothers, but still 7, come on people).  That's right, seventh (this does not include the ones in which I will merely be a spectator).  I love my friends and family and am so honored to be included in these special days and this is no diss on them in anyway.  This is all about me.  I mean, it's always about me anyway, right?    This year are the weddings of 2 very special people, my cousin who is like a sister to me and my best friend who basically is a sister to me.  These are probably the most special ones that I will be a part of and in my best friend's I am the maid of honor.  When she asked me, I cried, and then reality set in, this is my 7th time walking down the aisle, alone.  Oh, there are no pitty parties, Anna is an independent.  One friend said, 'Well, at least you're getting closer.'  I was like, um thanks, that's as close as I want to be, for now anyway.  So, I do my duties of planning and attending showers, giving my measurements to strangers (probably the worst part of the whole process), and being there for the bride in any way she might need.  I do all of this thinking, as Cinderfuckinrella (thanks Pretty Woman) did, that someday my prince will come.  But, oh no, don't think he needs to rescue me, no.  I've already rescued myself.  I want a prince for all the other reasons, plenty of cash, big house, private jet.  No, really, I want a prince who is prince of humanity in that he treats me and everyone I love with kindness, who is so funny that I laugh out loud just thinking about things he has done or said, who wants to learn to do things that I love just because I love them, and who wants me to do the same for him.  I think my friends (and cousin) have found these princes, I know they have.  I'm just hoping that they haven't gotten the last ones.          "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       I love NPR.  Music stations can make you feel like you are stuck on repeat of a mixed CD.  The same songs over and over.  People, please.  But then, there in the distance, on the hour, every hour, and during rush hour and some good hours on Friday night and Sunday, there is NPR to rescue me.  I like a pop song just as much as the next person, but I don't think that I ever actually will 'find [you] in a club with a bottle full of bub,' but I do know people who have taken prozac which now appears to be causing suicidal tendencies.  (I heard this tidbit before eyeing it on any other news source that day.)  I love the idea of multitasking, driving and getting abreast of what is, or is not, going on in the world.  I can't watch news on TV anymore, unless it's BBC and then only when I'm actually in England, because the inane (trying to be) analytic dribble drabble that procludes from these people's mouths is too much for me to stand.  I tell my father everytime that I am home that FoxNews is one of those broadcasts that actually does write its copy for people with an 8th grade education because that is there audience (if you didn't know, that's suppose to be the industry standard for level of writing, 8th grade, yeah I know).  He just ignores me and continues to be 'dumbed down.'  Newspapers are fine, but I don't have the dough to subscribe to them and reading a newspaper online just doesn't seem right to me.  And so, when I get in my car and I'm just sick of hearing the same 4 songs, I check the clock and thank God that it is after 4 in the afternoon and there is information to be learned as I drive  home.  Some days, I even leave early in the morning so that I can hear the more in-depth news as I drive in (the closer you get to 9am the more 'entertaining' the pieces get).  I mean, all things considered I just need a little fresh air to handle this American life.           "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       Today I heard a school secretary say to a little girl, 'Now, you're not going to get suspended anymore, are you?'  As I passed by the conversation I wanted to say, 'No, you're wrong.  This little GIRL wouldn't do something to get suspended.  I mean look at her, she's cute, well-dressed, calm, and polite.'  And then metacognition set in and I realized that I had just committed a mental act of sexism.  Our mothers might not understand why this scene might make us step back and take note of our place on the 'balance of the sexes.'  My mother didn't even begin college until I, her third child, was in elementary school.  And she is the only one of her sisters to have a college degree.  A few years ago, she got her Masters in Administration (approximately 1 year before I go my Masters), hoping to become a school principal.  It seems that her age has hindered those hopes, sexism replaced by ageism.  (My mom is older than my friends' parents.  She has a 39 year-old son after all.)  I'm not sure if this is really true, but she continued teaching and thanks to Bush's unfunded No Child Left Behind, she has, in fact, been left behind.  It now appears that she must have in hand a different type of Masters to do the same job she's been doing for 3 years.  But, I'm sure that 40 years ago she never would have thought she'd be worrying about what type of Masters Degree she had.  Former generations of women only hoped that women would have as many choices and possibilities that we do now, but with the entire world laid out before us, what do we really have but more questions?  What if we just want to be married and have children?  And that's it.  What if we want it that simple?  Is it sacrilege to not take advantage of the choices, or is that the whole point anyway?  I personally would feel no shame in dropping the 50,000 dollars and 20 plus years spent on my education to be a happy homemaker.  But, alas, baby making and the perfect spinach quiche are not the path I stumbled onto, nor will it be anytime in the near future.  After all, I have a research project due for my 'might turn into a PhD' class.          "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       When riding my bike and a slight hill appears I must use all my leg power to tackle the mere incline (I'm not talking real hills).  As I'm peddaling with more and more emphasis I can't help but be aware of my powerhouse legs.  My calves are huge and this is not actually related to me being overweight.  There are two reasons for my treetrunk legs.  First, there is genetics (I know, blame your mother).  But seriously, I've never seen the women in my family ever really break a sweat, sure there is the occasional walking of the dog, but no intense exercise going on, and yet these women do not have dainty legs.  We have legs built for... well I don't know what for.  The second reason is Linda Watkins School of Dance.  I was a dancer from age 4 to 18 and dancers have powerhouse legs, how else could they leap like that?  I tapped, balleted, toed, and jazzed my way through 14 years of jetes, plies, and time steps.  I usually hated dance class, but the recitals I lived for.  There is nothing like being on stage and performing.  My favorite was the kick line.  And still, years later, when I hear Elvis Costellos' 'Hot Hot Hot' (which is not that often) I want to throw some eye high kicks and do a split, oh there were splits.  Sadly, I couldn't do a split now if you paid me.  I miss the way a dancer knows her body, how every move is fluid and somehow perfectly calculated, even walking can be a dance.  Our dance instructor used to tell us a story about a dancer's grace.  The story goes that she was coming home from the grocery store holding a bag of groceries in each hand.  When she stepped up her back stairs to her house, she slipped on a thin layer of ice.  And this is where the grace comes in- she would emphasize that because she was dancer, she knew how to fall and thus landed safely on the ground, legs folded perfectly to soften the full body blow.  The strange thing is that I don't remember ever practicing or in fact ever falling in dance class, but I understood what she was saying.  A dancer's right hand always knows and reacts to what the left hand is doing.  I've never broken a bone, pulled a muscle, or torn a ligament, could this be due to the dancing?  I don't know but, thanks to Linda Watkins, when I'm 85 and fall down my front stairs, I may not in fact break my hip.                   "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       I was cruising on my bike through Windsor Farms today.  It's a posh neighborhood in Richmond's westend where the houses are big and beautiful, the yards are kept up by hired hands I'm sure, and all children go to St. Catherine's, or St. Christopher's (cause being educated along ghettofied kids is to much of a reality for these folks).  OK, so I would like to own a house here, but my kids would go to public school, damnit.  On my bike tour past the beautiful AgeCroft (yes, some aristocratic cook had the house torn apart and shipped over here from England, but this was a long time ago when ghettofied kids would have been slaves).  The house is amazing and has a prescious spot in Richmond, it rests on a small hill and looks out to a small mountain which has not been tainted with developments.  It's serene, and reminds me of my hometown and of my last home, C-ville.  Growing up among moutains, I hated them.  My hometown is in a valley and therefore surrounded on all sides as if the hills protect and keep the people below.  And, in many ways they did, my hometown is a sheltered place.  Though quaint at times, it could possibly be the redneck version of 'A City Upon (surrounded by) A Hill (hills).'  But, we all know what happens to Utopia, oh yeah, it doesn't exist.  So, for most of my life I have cursed the moutains and hills, especially when trying to learn how to drive a stick shift (I actaully gave up trying for a good year).  I didn't start to accept and reclaim them until this past summer in Montana.  I traveled to Montana for a friends wedding and when I stepped off the plane and found myself surrounded by mountains I thought I was back in my hometown except there are no semi-tall buildings and I don't think they know what urban sprawl is.  Throughout the weekend I kept thinking, 'What is so great about these moutains?'  OK, so they are huge and the ranges are much bigger than Virginia's and they are bit more pristine, but really, no Virginian would be that amazed as I wasn't.  Then when drving back to C-ville from the airport in DC and going up and down the rolling hills, I thought 'These are my hills, Montana has nothing on these.'  I think I began to love my state then.  I'm proud to be a Virginian which is saying something, considering I have always wished to be an North Carolinian.  Richmond has no hills or mountains to look at, we're too far east.  I actually miss them.  Some days as I'm driving to work I feel like I don't have everything that I need for the day, I check everything, my watch, my purse, my coffee and I and can't find the missing piece, but maybe it's the moutains, the Blue Ridge, that I'm missing, without really knowing it.

3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       My sister-in-law had an embroidered pillow which rested on her white loveseat which sat in an area off to the side of her kitchen in her former house.  The pillow said, in green thread, 'Bloom Where You're Planted' and of course had simple, colorful flowers sprouting underneath the words.  The first time I saw this pillow, I thought 'What a great saying.'  After 3 eye-opening, ego-blasting years in a teaching position that drove me to see a therapist, a move to a new city, a new job, and lots of downtime, I can now see the sunlight.  The cloud which followed me around all my life, much like the dust cloud that follows PigPen from Charlie Brown, has lifted.  The weather is not always clear, it rains and storms still, but mostly there are sunny days.  I've moved to Richmond to start over and when I first moved here I was so excited and thrilled to begin again and to do it right this time.  Well, 6 months into living here, I was not happy.  The cloud was back, my apartment was a shambles, and I hated waking up to go to work every morning.  I was obsessed with New York City and sad that I could not afford to move there or to London, or anywhere.  Then I began to repeat and reflect on that pillow in my sister-in-laws kitchen.  And while I'm not ready for blooming, at least for now, I think I'll germenate.  And I'm sure, with all this sunlight, a stem will form.   Next Time  Ginko trees live 1,000 years. Eating the leaves will clear you brain. When I heard about them, I thought of my mother, how much I would like to sit under one with her in the ancient shade, nibbling the flesh, the stem, the central vein.  ~Naomi  Shihab Nye           "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       I love the bridges of Richmond.  They are no architectural triumphs by any means.  They are simple and quiet, sometimes elegant, and to me, quite satisfying.    My favorite is the Nickel bridge.  It is a small two lane bridge that is made of intricate iron workings on either side and is lighted by short lamps which are part of the iron work.  It is a quaint bridge and one of the quite one I think.  As cars pass each other in close proximity, it's as if they are quitely saying hello to each other.    The one I take to work everyday, the Powhite Pkwy, is a toll bridge and although I pay everyday and hope that my $.50 will soon make enough of a difference that the tolls will soon go away, I make sure to enjoy the view on either side of me.  On the left is a train bridge that was clearly built when we took time for grandeur and beauty in transportation.  The train bridge is grey stone with slender arches that reach just under the flat top.  Everytime I look at this bridge I imagine riding in a cafe car on a train in the 20s, sipping tea and headed south to somewhere fabulous.  Just visible beyond the train bridge is the Nickel bridge, much shorter than the train bridge and sometimes I think it is a whisper of a bridge in the distance.  Back to the right side of the Powhit bridge.  On the right is only the James river and it's tree lined banks.  The river is a bit rocky at this point and every morning I can gauge the level of percepitation west of Richmond.  When the river is at a normal level, birds perch on some rocks that barely rest above the water level.  The first time I saw I bird sitting on one of these tiny rocks, I wondered if he thought himself a daredevil.   The Hugenot bridge is at the end (or beginning) of Cary St.  It extends into the posh westend of Richmond.  This bridge is two lanes with rails on either side that mimic a picket fince in metalic piping.  But, it's length is what is so fascinating.  It goes for at least a quarter mile and part of is not over water at all.  When you start the bridge from the Cary St. side you enter and curve around into a grove of trees.  Because it's a bridge a this point, you feel as if you are suspended through a small forest.  As you curve around, train tracks appear quickly and then the banks of the of the river.  It's a bit like a fairytale bridge, no exactly magical, but unnexpected.  The Willey Memorial Bridge mimics the Hugenot bridge in length and setting, but is far different in description.  The bridge is all concrete and lit by standard street lights.    The Lee Memorial bridge is my least favorite.  It connets downtown to a area that could be referred to as the 'projects,' a sad and large part of this troubled town.  This bridge is open to pedestrians on either side so that the blank concrete feel is even more guarded by chain link fencing.  Although the bridge is wide with four lanes, you feel boxed in and can't see the water underneath.  The idea and realization of being suspended over rushing water does elevate the drab feel of this bridge for the brief trip over the James.  The 2nd st. bridge is another non-descript bridge, but on the downtown bank there is a memorial to Vietnam veterans of Virginia.  It's a beautiful memorial, a large stone wall in the background, a grand shape of a women inside, behind a glass wall.  I've haven't seen it up close, it's on my list of things to do.  Just the other day I discovered an walking suspension bridge under the 2nd st. bridge.  The walking bridge literally hangs below the towering car bridge above.  It reminds me of the Millineum Bridge in London, another beautiful walking suspension bridge.                   "

I'm a Virginian by birth, but this my first time living in the capitol city.  I'm a teacher for children with special needs in public schools.  I used to teach children with Autism which was fascinating.  For a long time, Autism was my passion.  At times, I still yearn to work with those kids again.  I'm damn good at it, but the culture of Autism is too abrasive for me.  It's a complicated, long story.  I love the kids, it's just everything that surrounds them and thus henders a teacher's effectiveness was too much for me.  I like what I do now, but not sure if I love it.  What does it mean to love a job?  What does it mean to love anything?  I just turned 27 with no fanfair and am in the throws of confusion and searching that inhabits all 20somethings.  Things about me:  when 'Sex and the City' ended I felt like my best friends moved away.  I love my nieces and nephew.  I love to read pop fiction (yes, Bridget Jones is a friend of mine).  I have TiVo.  I used to write poetry (fairly seriously in college and worked with some big names).  I have a very well decorated apartment, it's beautiful if I do say so myself.  I love to cook and don't do it enough.  I need to learn to exercise frequently.  I wish that I could: take amazing photographs, publish some poems/ book/ picture/ dna, travel to any city anytime, live in NYC, live in London, etc.               "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       Do you remember watching music videos?  I mean really watching them, like for hours.  My brother and I, along with some neighborhood kids at times, would sneak snippets of MTV.  We were banned from such filth as kids though we seemed to watch endless amounts of it, our parents not as quick as they were prudish.    I was enamored with George Michael.  Funny, he never seemed gay to me at age 10, but then again I didn't know what gay was then either.  He was the perfection of hotness to me and that song, Careless Whisper, where he crones after a lover lost and that stubble, whew that stubble.   These days, he's not so hot and I wonder why I never saw the obvious 'batting for the other team' going on, but again, this was the 80s, I don’t think he was letting many people in on his secrets, lest he lose album sales.  A few months ago I was flipping through the channels and found FUSE, a music video channel here in Richmond where all they do is play videos.  I was stunned.  Some flashy hip-hop song was on and I paused, filling the commercial time during another program and actually watched a whole video.  I felt like I was 12 again, the volume turned down, the den door closed, and my finger on the remote ready to switch channels should the door open and my mother walk in.   I haven't watched another video since that FUSE moment months ago.  I miss the old videos where the stories were weak, if anything, the bands were overly made up, and the women had clothes on.  The current generation has no idea what endless, mindless hours of music videos are like.  They think MTV was created to expose the unreality of 18-23 lives.  The teeny boppers today won't have slumber parties and stay up late to see how many times their favorite videos appear.  They're lucky if they see their favorite video once during the terribly drab TRL.    And, what happened to a music video doing magic for the unknown artists?  The one hit wonders of the 80s would be nowhere without their videos.  Remember Divo and the whips?  My brother's band made a video a few years ago.  And if you blinked you missed it.  It did nothing for them because kids don't watch videos anymore, they want the (non) reality shows or the watered down, over-produced, uncreative pop star in their mist, and they only want the 10 best knows videos of the day.  Or at least, this is what MTV thinks they want.  MTV has gone from groundbreaking to heartbreaking.  And VH1, don't even let me go there.  And it's sad to realize that I am no longer the target audience of MTV.  They don't care about my demographic anymore, even though I busted my butt sneaking hours of videos into my childhood.  Sorry Dire Straits, you can have your money for nothin'.  It turns out I don't want my MTV.          "

Then pointed to me and said, 'You're the dirty rascal.'  And I was immediately placed inside the melody of CRASH.  I was irrovacably sadden that my childhood is now wrapped inside the lyrics of a Dave Matthews song.   Then later, in the backyard waiting for the hotdogs on the grill I heard a bright, highpicthed song lingering in the air.  I knew immediately that it was an ice cream truck.  Whew!

No, none of them are famous.  We're funny the way your family is funny.  The way you take family or friendly information and turn it around, spin it on it's head, give it a sarcastic tone or link it to a historical travesty and spit it back into the air.  My relatives have dry and sarcastic one-liners down to a science.  It's like a racket ball game when we are gathered together. The puns and witty observations fly so fast you’re not sure you can hurl them back, but then, you do, you always do.  And so, I find friends who can play this game, who can come together in one accord on making fun of the world and each other.    Friday night, sitting amongst a group of co-workers for 'happy hour' I was anything but happy.  Oh, I was jovial and jokey and witty and brilliant, but somewhere along the line I realized that this wasn't the real funny me.  I had to work hard that night to tone my references down and to pull what little information I knew about these people to the front of my brain.  I've only worked with them for 6 months and this is only the third large group social thing we've done.  There is a few staff I know really well and with them I can joke all day, there is enough reference material there, but when you stick me with a large group of people I only see in the hallways I can't do much.      My jokes on Friday landed on unfertile ground.  There were some hits, but mostly misses.  When you don't know the people well, you're jokes and puns and one liners have to come from outside the group, I usually choose current events, historical events, local events, world events, OK so anything really.  But I'm sad to say I don't think my audience understood my references.  There was a discussion of a painting in the Mexican restaurant, which was of a man holding his own head.  I said I thought it was John The Baptist and then asked whose name was signed.  It was Raphael.  I stated again that I was pretty sure it was John The Baptist.  A co-worker said, 'Is it a religious thing?'  'Um,' I thought, 'I give up.'   Then there was my self-deprecating comment when another co-worker asked if I had gone to VCU with him, that I looked like someone in his ethics class.  I stated that I had no ethics, so no, I didn't go to VCU.  He didn’t bowl over with laughter.  'What’s wrong with you?' I thought and then realized I don't really know these people.    Sometimes I don't want to spend all that time it takes to get to know people, I just want it to be immediate.  My cousin's wife was telling me about a dinner party she and 5 other women have every month.  They get together and discuss politics by having various members' research topics then they come together to discuss.  She said she thought of me and that this is something right up my alley.  Well, after tonight and the failed attempts at garnering some sort of recognition for my brilliant repartee, I think she is right.  I need some good conversation, I need some deep thinking, I some cognitive stimulation.           "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       I went to Carytown today with my brother's little family.  My 6 year-old nephew's artwork was being displayed in a window of a store there, part of a city-wide school art project.  He was 1 of 2 children chosen from his 1st grade class to be placed for all the passersby to see.  It was a great picture full of blue and red and purple and white and yellow.  There was clearly a sky with clouds and then there are 2 distinct sections on the bottom.  One blue square section takes up the majority of the picture with two building shaped things inside.  To the right of the large blue square is a skinny blue rectangle with an American flag in it, just hanging out.   I asked the little artiste what exactly he had painted and he shrugged.  His grandmother said it was a house and then I asked 'Well, is it a house that you thought up in your mind or a particular house?'  He said he just thought it up.  'All right, well, good picture little boy.'    I then began talking and playing with the little nieces when the artiste's mom states that the two buildings are 'Our house and Annie’s apartment building.'  I turned my body and swung my head around, 'What, my apartment building?'  To which the little one said 'Yeah' in his sweet, Well-what-else-could-it-be-? voice.  I looked at the picture again and there it was in all the many colors.  It was clearly a small one-story house sitting beside a 3-story brick apartment building.  How did I not see it before?  I said, 'Well, look at that, I'm famous.'  And then the love swept over me.  When a 6 year old paints your apartment building into a picture, that is love, real love.  Thank you my little A----baby.  I love you too.         "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       I believe that dog-earing pages in a book is sac-religious.  I think I may have engaged in this practice when I was 12 for a day or two, but it never stuck.  It seemed too finite a thing to do.  Reading a book is a fluid thing.  Though you stop, put it down, go on about your life and come back to it, the story is fluid, or should be.  So, to me, dog-earing the pages is like telling the pages, even the words to stop going, stop moving because the crease is always there.  It stands as an acknowledgement that someone paused this scene, stopped the monologue, or took a break between chapters.  It will take days of hard pressing to reduce the dog-eared indentation.  For me, the damage is permanent.  Literal and literary disrespect has occurred, something a book can never shake off.  So I use anything I can get my hands on to save my places.  I have bookmarks, but they never seem to find their way into the books.  In bookstore checkout lines I see pretty little bookmarks with clichéd phrases and artsy black and white pictures and salivate.  But my Pavlovian reflexes are always pushed aside because I know that the $3 bookmark will sit in a drawer or beside a stack of books and never actually make it into one.  There is no real reason for this.  When I need to hold my place I franticly search for something flat or something related to the process of reading.  Beside my bed there are a number of books 'held' by varying objects.  The most frequently read book has my glasses holding court, the short story book that I dip in and out of is splayed, open side down on a table, a book of memoirs is conversing with my itty bitty book light™, a travel book on London is held in place with the thin, red, satin ribbon attached to it, and another short story book has the receipt for itself tucked inside.   The receipt is my favorite placeholder.  I think this is partly sentimental in that every time I open the book I look at it and remember the store and the circumstances for the purchase.  Partly I'm sure I do this to subconsciously remind myself to get every bit of escapism and pleasure out of the $10.95 I spent on the paperback edition.  And partly because it's convenient and perfect.  A receipt takes up no space between the pages, it doesn't ask you to clip it on, it just slides right in like it was meant to be there and it never leaves a mark.  It's the answer to the damaging dog-ear.  It's the lazy woman’s pause button.  It's quite possibly the very best un-bookmark.  Yesterday I was digging through my assortment of not-yet-read books and discovered an odd bookmark tucked inside Carson McCullers' THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER.  I'm sure at the time, my former therapist's business/ appointment card was the closest thing around when I stopped reading.  I can't imagine that I just randomly put this card in this book.  It was slipped between pages 4 and 5.  A bookmark placed so early in a book would make me think that I never really began reading it.  Maybe I went for a teaser from the first couple of pages.  I have a terrible habit of beginning books and then about 20-50 pages into it, I pick up another book (see the bedside assortment listed above).  This is one of my worst habits and one I really hate. Commitment phobia rears it's ugly head in some many places in my life.  I just can't help but think there is a small, or rather quite large, message in THAT card in THAT book.  Sometimes I wonder...            "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       I have seasoned chicken in the oven right now.  The smell is amazing and began wafting from the kitchen about 10 minutes after I put it in the 350º box.  The smell is of earthy paprika, pungent garlic, and sweet basil.  It smells like home, like a weekday dinnertime when a family's house is quiet after a day of harried activities and mouths are watering.   My father gave me this container which describes its contents as 'The World’s Best Chicken Rub.'  He bought it at Food Lion, a place I never go because Ukrop's has spoiled me and I am OK with the overpriced ingredients for my cooking, or lack there of.  I don't even know where a Food Lion is around here.  I'm sure I've passed one on my travels trough town, but I couldn't tell you where.  The seasoning gift was unexpected and handed to me in the Food Lion bag with the receipt still inside.  Two containers where purchased, one for me and for my brothers family.  I think I was the afterthought, but my dear sweet dad didn't want to leave me out.     The seasoning is described as a 'rub' and the directions tell you to brush the seasoning mixed with oil and lemon juice over the chicken.  In my kitchen, the brush consists of a plastic bag and there is no lemon juice.  A poor single girl's kitchen is usually devoid of fancy cookery, i.e. brushes or fresh citrus.  I actually do own a cooking brush, however, I believe I bought it at the dollar store and then only in the hopes that I would someday make delicate puff pastries brushed with butter.  I have made none so far.    The brush did make an appearance two weeks ago on Easter weekend when my visiting mother sort of decided I would cook a ham for the family on Saturday night.  I didn't know until I was cooking it that this would be my job.  I've never cooked a ham before.  Luckily, store-bought spiral sliced hams are pre-cooked, you just have to know how to heat them up and glaze them.  The glazing scared me and when I asked my mom how to do this she simply said 'brown sugar and mustard.'  'OK,' I thought 'but how the hell much of either one?'  I couldn’t ask her again, she was busy with my little nieces and there was an air of 'Have you learned nothing from me?' in her voice.  I looked in the cupboard and found a clump of petrified brown sugar and of course there is always mustard in the fridge.  I remembered that brown sugar comes back to life with heat so I set the stove to high flame, put the brown sugar and a splash of water in a small pot, squirted about 6 seconds worth of mustard and stirred.  The resulting taste test was good; it tasted familiar, like sweet Easter ham.    Two hours into the ham warm-up I pulled it out and brushed on my brown sugary mixture.  The glaze was perfect, sweet and tart and just right for a first time try.  My parents let me keep the leftovers because I'm poor and because they live 3 hours away.  I said thanks, that I'd eat on it all week.  I didn't touch it after they left, despite my glaze of glory.  The first few months I lived on my own with no dining hall or catering company to feed me (college dorms and sorority respectively) I bought more food than 3 people could eat in 2 months almost each week.  I researched and concocted difficult recipes from Martha Stewart and Junior League cookbooks.  I even spent 3 hours on a fancy dinner for a going away party for a friend once.  (I've since learned that friends will come over for your grilled cheese as much for your 'whole roasted chicken with goat cheese and sage.')  Now, I've settled into the typical single girl's fridge.  I have a door full of condiments waiting for a salad or bread and meat or even fries, but I have none of those things actually in the fridge to put them upon.   In college, my fridge was stocked for weekends and nights I just didn't want to leave the apartment to go eat with my 'sisters.'  One roommate and I would try to make what we thought were balanced meals.  We would go grocery shopping and come home to heat up canned beans, boil a bag of rice, and bake chicken with rosemary in tinfoil for 45 mins.  We thought our moms would be proud.  We also bought an entire red velvet cake once and after 2 days gave up the polite slicing and plating to simply spear it with a fork as we stood at the kitchen counter in our pajamas and bare feet and chatted about how we had really sunk to a new low.  During the day today I had a brilliant thought of going to the store after work to pick up a fresh lemon to squeeze in the bag with the chicken and over some freshly cooked rice.  I never made it to the store and the poor herbed chicken has no side dishes, no friends to share the stomach with.  A single girl just doesn't have the time or the energy really for all the fuss, and especially all those dishes.  There will probably be no leftovers either (what with the 1 piece of chicken I fixed), my fridge will go another day (or 10) with not much more than fancy mustard and light Italian dressing.  But, right now my dinner's calling me.         "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       Miraculously my blessed computer is now typing.  I have no idea why it decided to go bananas and turn the letters 'HJKL andM' into '1234 and 5.'  I took it to school today and I think maybe my baby didn't like being away from home.  I wasn't that upset as my computer has been showing signs of trouble for a few months and I expect that everyday may be it's last day.  I have an order to send it in to Apple but am terrified that they will wipe out the memory and start over with all the programs.  This makes me want to run away with my sweet sick computer and try to nurse it back to health.  But, I know I can’t do that.  So I'll have to work on saving all my things like my music and documents and pictures.  This is not that hard, just dump it on a disc, but I have a habit of rereading things and going through everything and reminiscing.  What should take me about 2-3 hours will probably take me 2-3 days.  I'm just sentimental like that.    My laptop is my baby.  In fact, that's its name, My Baby.  In the upper right hand corner of my Macintosh G4 Titanium is a tiny replica of my hard drive and the words 'My Baby' underneath.  My laptop is one of my best friends.  Not like 'Oh I can’t wait to go home and type on my computer.'  But kinda.  And no, I'm not a computer nerd.  I use it for writing and Internet and well… music and pictures and to watch movies and a to play a game for about an hour every 6 months or so.  It's like a best friend who enjoys a good flick, listens to my favorite tunes, and doesn't disagree with my neurotic banter, AND travels with me almost everywhere I go.   This current computer is 2 years old, but is still fabulous.  When I bought my G4, my older G3 was only 2 years old and one of my brothers thought that I was crazy to buy another one and asked which one I liked better.  I stated that it was like choosing between two children, it was like Sophie's Choice, the Apple Macintosh version.  If you like Macs then you LOVE them.  There are few Mac people who could go either way, PC or Mac.  I am quite obsessed with my Macs.  I've had 3 so far and used pretty much every version they have come out with.  They are beautiful, efficient, and easy to use machines.  This is the first time I have ever had enough trouble with one that the friendly techies on the Apple help line couldn't solve.  This is the first time they have asked for me to hand over my baby.  I'm scared, but today with the typing fiasco I came to terms with having to let go for bit and let the experts do their thing.  Then I realized that my G3 was still available.  I couldn't wait to get home and dig it out, to feel the tall, black keys under my fingers.  Pressing them is like pressing down on soft dough.  It makes writing fluid and effortless.  I miss that keypad.    When I opened the black chunky laptop I ran my hands over its edges.  The design team at Apple gave the G3 PowerBook curves, like a woman.  The edges are smooth and shapely; the sides of the computer make subtle 'S' shapes.  It's high fashion, computer style.  I miss the friendly rainbow Apple at the base of the screen.  It goes to show that Apple did not make a big enough impact on the world market to claim the rainbow Apple without bringing along the rainbow symbol and all of its stereotypes.  Apple now goes for a sleek mono-colored, often white or grey, Apple, a more stylish replacement to its colorful twin.  The rest of my G3 is simple and elegant.  There are no extra buttons to 'go straight to the internet,' 'open you’re email,' or anything else that junks up a PC keyboard.  There could be key functions that did those things for me of course, but I get to decide, Apple does not predetermine my preferences.  I think the thing I love most about Apple is the company's adherence and strive for simplicity.  Their computers have clean lines and their mice have one button, not five.  Choices can complicate life.  A simple gift, that is was Apple has given us in its computers.  PC people think that we Mac people are strange.  'The whole world is Windows and you are using a Mac.  You poor deluded youth,' someone once told me.  I told him he better step back and then began my rant on why Macs reign supreme.  I was showing someone a keying shortcut on a Mac (like open Apple and s for save) and explaining the ease and simplicity of Macs and she said 'Oh, they got those shortcuts from Windows.'  I said, 'No you didn't' and then explained how Bill Gates just made a PC version of the perfected Mac interface because people were sick of having to remember which drive to boot up and save on.  Deluded youth indeed.  My cousin says she would rather go without a computer than own a PC, which is what she is currently doing.  She gets her Mac on at work.    It's a far better place at the top of world my friends.  Come to the land of milk and Apples, we are a friendly, simple-minded, and visionary bunch.  And remember... as you sulk at us that almost every piece of music or visual media you hear or see has been touched by Apple.    *Anna is OK with being in love with her computer.         "

Um, OK.  Have to send it off.  I'm scared they will erase it's memory and leave me with a shell of a computer and I will have to start all over.  But, I can't exactly do anything on it unless I develop a code language using 01234 and 5.  But, who has time for that?         "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       Yesterday I stopped by my nephew's soccer practice just to say hi and show him how much I love him.  He loves to show off, but he also gets frustrated with not being perfect when he kicks the ball.  He's 6.  He has a lot of perfectionist disappointments ahead of him.  While I was there a mother of another child came up to talk to my sister-in-law.  She was asking who was the mother of whom and I said I was just an aunt.  She stated how nice it was that I came out to see my nephew.    During school yesterday a teacher was telling me about a girl who was behaving badly (there is a long story about how bad this teacher is and how she creates the behavior problems in her classroom, but that is for another day).  The teacher was talking about the girl and how she lives with her aunt because her own mother is in jail.  The teacher was trying to point out to the girl that she needed to straighten up because he aunt was good to her even though money was tight in her house.  I hear these stories all the time, an aunt or a grandmother or even a great aunt taking custody kids in their families.  For some reason, yesterday, it hit me that this is wonderful and strange at the same time.  Another little boy told me a few weeks ago with a smile on his face that his daddy was out of jail.  This was a follow up to the statement 'my daddy in jail' that preceded a few weeks before.  I often don't know how to react to these statements and they are frequent.   Richmond is a troubled town.  The murder rate here evens out to about 10 murders a month.  That is unbelievable to me.  Crime is so prevalent that it isn't even a frequent topic of conversation.  The newscasters announce the death tolls almost nightly, but my friends and I don't worry because most murders are gang or drug related.  This makes us feel safer, but should it?  I've become desensitized to so much in this town.  I'm not shocked when teachers or kids tell me about people going into or getting out of jail or prison and I'm not surprised by bodies being found behind school buildings or churches being burned down.    I can't help but think that most of my feelings about family members taking on the responsibility of other family members is cultural.  Yesterday, though, I realized when that mother at the soccer field was so impressed that an aunt came out to a soccer practice that I'm so thankful that my nieces and nephew don't live with me.  I can't imagine taking custody of these kids because my brother was in jail (I would of course, but I can't imagine it).  I just can't even fathom it for my family and yet when a child tells me something like this I don't even flinch.  It seems so normal in the schools I teach in.  I realized yesterday that my desensitization is a bad thing.  It causes complacency and this will never help a child.  But, what can I say for Kindergartener whose role models are in jail that will stay with him and keep him off the streets when he grows up?           "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       This is a quote from a graduate of my college from my graduating year,  'I am about to finish up two year of MBA education at the Wharton School and will start work in September at McKinsey & Co in their Brussels office. Between graduation and starting work I plan to bicycle across the USA in 48 days...'  Our five year reunion is this summer and some people have chosen to update all those who are waiting with bated breath to see what they have been up to over that last five years.  The above update caught my eye because really, as if the Wharton School wasn't enough this guy had to throw in his hot job in Brussels and then of course the side note about the cyclying across the USA, but that wasn't enough, no, then he had to add that he'll do it in 48 days.  Sometimes, I wish I had gone to a podunk small town college where I would send in updates like 'I just consolidated my debt and hope to be out of my misery is 5 to 10 years.'  And my podunk fellow classmates would think 'Wow, I really wish my life were as on track as hers.  I really need to reassess my life and get my goals straight.'  OK, well, anyway, I've got to run.  My bicycle needs to ridden, around the block in 48 minutes.  Wahoowah!          "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       Yesterday, Bunny Day, I was driving out to my sister-in-laws' parents' house for Easter dinner (yeah, we're all close like that) and noticed store after store closed.  Her parents live in the suburbs... (sorry, I just puked) and there is mega store juxtaposed to mega store juxtaposed to posh mall along the way to their house.  This is how it went down inside my head:  'Hmm.  Why is Best Buy closed?  What time is it?  It's only 4pm.  Oh yeah, Easter.  But Best Buy is corrupt and charges restocking fees.  Why are they all of a sudden holy?  More like Best Butt to me.  OK, there are no cars in front of World Market, Home Depot, ah Kroger, there you go guys, sell those hams.  Target is closed.  What the?  McDonald's?  You mean I can't go get a Big Mac cause the Easter Bunny is busy.  What?  Oh, Wal-Mart.  Good, dear sweet heathen Wal-Mart.  Damn, rednecks like to shop on Easter, that parking lot is full.  Is Sam Walton rolling over in his grave?  Nordstrom, good for you.  You show them how to fear God, close you store.'  Um, I guess I've never been out on Easter Sunday to realize that we still observe this holiday by barring heathens from their purchases.  I guess I am now a heathen.  Well, good, really, I don't believe in judging people for their religious beliefs anyway so um, a heathen I may be, but I still hang out with non-heathens and other heathens and I love them all.    I think it says a good deal about a company to close on a religious holiday in this country, being that the majority of corporations seem to pray to the God of the U.S. Mint rather than the Almighty.  I didn't even go to church yesterday.  This is the first Easter that I haven't been to church.  I just wasn't down with going to Mass with the rest of my family (the only Catholic is my sister-in-law) cause they don't think I'm Christian enough to drink their wine (Catholics do it right, there is no grape juice up in their joints).  So, I slept and joined the fam. for the important part, the food.  OK, so this is all blasphemous of me to say.  But, I probably would have gone shopping yesterday being none the wiser.  I had no idea we were that pious a nation what with Blue Laws being banished within the last 20 years.  Alright, well, you go people, stand up for something, except of course Kroger and Wal-Mart, you guys keep selling on major holidays cause you never know, I might need to buy some ice or a fishing pole at the last minute.

3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       This past week was my Spring Break from school and I spent most of it tidying up loose ends and looking for a condo (not successfully).  All in all, not an exciting week considering that this time last year I was getting over my jet lag from London.   Last year that I had a longing to revisit my favorite city in all the world.  After my first tiring and horrendous year of teaching, I was planning on going backpacking through Europe with a girlfriend of mine, but she backed out.  Then, I thought I would spend a summer in London as a reward for getting through the fire, but I failed to ever find out how to rent a flat for a reasonable fee for a few months.  So, two years later, after 9/11 and with a pending war in Iraq, I decided that I would go to London, by myself.  There is a time when you realize waiting around for other people isn't worth it.    Luckily, British Airways had cheap tickets and AAA travel helped secure a great cheap hotel and off I went.  My family was not pleased AT ALL.  My brothers were convinced I would be blown up mid flight, my mother thought I would be killed on the streets, but I (and my therapist) thought why live in fear?  I almost backed out though, because at the time the war in Iraq was only a month old and I did get scared.  But I knew I had to get through the bit of fear for many reasons.  So, here is what got my on the plane; I thought, sure I can stay here and be safe and not take the risk and it will drive me crazy because the plane on which I have a reservation will be flying with or without me so I can be on it and be in London or sit here for a week and wish that I had gotten on it, because after all the worrying it didn't blow up.  So, I got on the plane and I loved every minute of it.    It was wonderful and fabulous and there are not enough cliched things to say.  I saw 4 West End shows and revisited my favorite spots and went to museums and shopped and loved it.  A good many people think that it was ballsy of me to go and to go alone.  I've never had that feeling about that trip.  My parents instilled great traveling skills in me and traveling just feels like breathing sometimes.  I love it and I must do it.  I think I am my best self when I am traveling.  I'm an easy traveler.  I don't stress about what the day will bring or getting through an itinerary because the best things happen when you don't plan.  There are too many stories to back up that statement, but the places and cities at the moment should be the tour guides, not a piece of paper or a set schedule.    I missed the traveling this break.  I had planned to treat Richmond as if I were a tourist this week and go to the historical places and museums that I've been meaning to go to, but the week slipped away from me and now I have a paper due.  Sometimes, the real world is not quite a nice as the magical, mystical, travel filled one inside my head.  Oh well, there are always books to take me there.  I'm currently (and just now) reading CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET by Sophie Kinsella, a British novelist.  I bought the book last year in Harrods of all places because I knew that it was not in the US yet and I enjoy her books.  They are the mindless Chick Lit type that a girl just needs sometimes (don't worry I also bought some Seamus Heaney).  So, I hadn't read it until now because I've been trying to read a little more high-brow (though not much more- maybe just a brow lift).  So, I got it out the other night and read a few chapters each day.  Then, in B&N the other day I saw it is out in hardback as a new release.  Funny, how it's not new to me at all and yet it is new, now.     Last year I took Kinsella's book SHOPOHOLIC TIES THE KNOT to London as I had just begun to read it before the trip.  It's about a girl who loves to shop (obviously) who is British, but lives in NYC, but goes back to England to get married (again, obvious).  I would take it on the Tube to read between stops because I also feel that when traveling, you don't need to always act like a tourist (do what the locals do, read on the Tube).  So, I was on the Circle line train going to Leicester Square by way of Embankment reading and reading and being nonchalant. The funny thing is that I was reading about the main character visiting her friend in London and going out for tea in Sloane Square when the train stopped and the doors opened and I heard the announcement of Sloane Square station.  Sometimes, the universe just aligns.  And, no, I don't believe in that crap, but sometimes... Sloane Square and Sloane Square meet and I just can't compete.           "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       And by the devil I mean Uncle Sam.  I now have to sell my soul and get a second job.  Turns out, I do owe taxes (see 4/3/2004 post).  I went back today to pick up the papers that had been sent to the processing center and there it was in black and white tiny type 'You owe (arrow) {a shitload}.'  Thanks Uncle Sam, thanks.  The reason why I owe in the first place is because I tutored some kids with Autism last year.  And, being the honest taxpayer that I am, I reported all income and expenses and now I owe.  That sucks.  Honesty, sometimes, not the best policy for my I-really-want-to-go-shopping-but-now-I-have-to-get-another-job self.  'O where o where has my little life gone?'  Over the hill to 'Do you need any help or are you just looking?'  I'm thinking Barnes and Noble again.  I love that place.  OK, so most of me wishes that small independent bookshops were the norm rather than giant corporate monsters, but when I walk in there and there are a million books on any subject and the Starbucks and the prettiness, oh the prettiness of it all.  I love that place.  I have to work there, not because I love it, but because I have to, to pay the damn taxes and thereby accrue more taxes and then next year get another job and, oh god, will the cycle ever end?  Fraid not.          "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       I hate it when I settle into a quiet night of phone calls to my friends and not one of my dear friends is home.  There is nothing like a warm-hearted answering machine to make a girl feel loved.  I mean my friends are fabulous.  They are kind and funny and fun and far away.  Distance from my good friends hurts sometimes and so when I call them out of an act of loneliness and they are not at home, the loneliness gets deeper.  Their fabulousness outshines my fabulousness to nothing and I go back to what I was doing before the desperate plea for conversation.    Tonight, I got 6 messages and 1 number out of service.  The latter was a friend of a friend that I've been meaning to have over for dinner, but come on people.  Then I think about why I wanted to talk anyway.  So much of the time I am just ranting on in my neurotic self-obsessed way and what is in it for them?  I hope that I am a good friend, but I know that have my bad moments.  One particular friend is excellent at getting me to divulge more and more information.  She is a question asker and she is a lawyer.  She asks for more and more info. to the point that I have to stop myself and say 'OK, so what’s up with you?' about 45 mins. into our phone calls.  She is great, but she also feeds my self-obsession.  She's also taught me the act the listening because she does it so well.  Then there is my best friend who's mother is a school counselor, need I say more.  While she herself, doesn't have a degree in counseling, she's actually a science nerd, (you know I love you PK) she is fabulous at her second job.  And she does this for all her friends.  In fact, she is so good she just may pick friends based on their level of neediness. Hmmmmm!   The immediate lonliness was brought on by my re-watching of my 'Sex And The City' DVDs.  I just really miss my girlfriends sometimes.  I miss the closeness that women can have in true friendships when you live in close proximity.  My best friend lives across the country and my other dear friends live 2-24 driving hours away.  Oh, the mark of having successful, adventurous, independent women friends!    So, I sit down and write and try to work out whatever brought me to the phone in the first place.  I think about what my friends are doing right now that takes them away from their phones.  Are they out with other friends?  Are they watching a movie?  Are they discussing recently read books?  Are they organizing fundraisers?  Are they laughing?  Are they happy?  I hope they are laughing.  I hope they are happy.  They are my friends and I love them.           "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       On Monday I started the possibility of the process of buying my own place.  I just met with a realtor, that's all, no paper-signing going on, no commitments, yet.  It's a scary thing this idea of home ownership, signing away your life for 30 years.  It's a good idea, financially, but mentally, is this good for me?    I have a few single girlfriends who have bought places.  Two friends in Richmond bought houses.  I think they have balls.  Not that home ownership is that big of a deal, but a house is a big deal.  I personally can't go that big.  The mowing, the pruning, roof replacement, window washing, it's too much.  I can barely handle keeping my 6-room apartment in orderly shape.  I can just imagine the letters from neighbors that I would get concerning the jungle that would certainly grow outside my home.  So a condo, a condo sounds good to me.  It's like an apartment, but I'd get to paint the walls and a tax deduction.    Condo searching is hard.  While I'm still in the beginning stages, I've already seen 3 in person and a bunch online.  Nothing has caught my eye.  I think I am waiting for the perfect one to just fall into my lap.  I'm picky, but open-minded.  I've told my realtor that I'm interested in city properties and no new construction.  I want an old, lived in, worn and wise place.  My very nice, my age, trying to sell me a place realtor took notes.  I checked for a ring. There was one.  What does it say about me when the men I am not attracted to are married?  Does that mean that somewhere out there there is someone who would love my winning personality and bright smile?  Oh, this is not blog about me wanting a relationship.  This is a blog about me wanting, something, a little more of myself, I guess.  There are friends who say, 'You will find him when you least expect it.'  A good friend who is getting married this summer tells every single girl who claims they are OK with being single that they should watch what they say because she felt the same way last year and poof she's getting married.  Well, with my relationship phobias, I haven't been expecting it for um, 27 years so, um where is the unexpected?  OK, I'm still not ready for all that commitment, so am I ready to commit to a condo?  We will surely see.           "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       There is the old cliche that music can change your mood in an instant.  Oftentimes, I am the cliche.  Driving in my car a song on the radio will put in the mood for shopping, reading a book, or dancing within the span of 8 minutes.  The emotional hills and valleys that I go through listening to music come up as quickly as the mileposts on the highway.  On Saturdays, when there is work to be done in my apartment, I open the blinds or windows, turn up the radio on an upbeat (usually hip hop) station and get busy.  Choosing one CD to listen during one period of productive time is more difficult.    I have a habit of listening to an album until it is worn out and tired.  I get a new album and listen to it over and over.  I've been known to put certain songs or even the whole CD on repeat for hours.  Because of this, I know every word to albums of bands like U2, Sarah Mclachlan, James, Harry Connick Jr., Billy Brag and Wilco, Michelle Shocked, David Wilcox, Jimmy Buffet, and show tunes like Les Mis and Phantom.  So much useless information floating around my brain taking up space for real knowledge like whom all of my government representatives are and how they vote in their various arenas.  I know that this mind hoarding of information happens to everybody to some degree, but not only do lyrics hide in my long-term memory, but with those lyrics and melodies are visual, olfactory, and textural memories.  Songs, and especially whole albums can bring back days, events, and sometimes-whole years.  Like James 'Laid' CD evokes the memory or Camp Morehead where I was a (non-sailing) counselor for one summer in high school.  I had brought the only CD player for the cabin so I forced the 12-13 year old girls to listen to my brooding British music.  Camp Morehead was dismantled a few years ago and the land sold to people building their dream second homes on the shores of many peoples childhood summers.  I actually hated camp, but every once in a while when I listen to 'Laid' I wish for the slow breeze coming off the Bogue Sound and all the little SunFish sailing in the wind.  There is another CD in my collection that I bought in the Dominican Republic on spring break my last year in college.  A resident of the house my friend and I stayed in played a native Dominican's CD everyday so it became the soundtrack to our visit.  The music is poorly produced and there are barking dogs used as part of the beat on one song, but that CD is probably the best souvenir I've ever gotten from a trip.  Sometimes, in summer, I'll put it on in my car; roll all the windows down and just drive, thinking of the Dominican.  There are many more CDs and even more recollections.  And so all these memories attached to my music cause the choosing of music to listen to at a particular time quite difficult.  There are rows and rows of CDs in my collection that I just can't bring myself to play because friends and trips and times in my life are gone and can't be reclaimed.  Nostalgia is sad state for me and one I only visit when I really miss someone or someplace.  And I'm so thankful when sometimes; somehow with new places and good friends I have the opportunity to attach new memories to the music.            "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       that all the world should be taxed.  And so I went to a local tax place that was giving free tax service to teachers (gotta love those perks).  It took two nights because I had to wait the first night for another customer.  As I waited an older man who is a retired accountant and who's son owns the business began to organize my papers.  He was friendly and we talked for at least an hour.  Of course, he knew a lot about me because my life was displayed in numbers before him, but he also told me about his ex-wife who left him six months ago and all the improvements he had personally done on his house that he is now trying to sell.  While he was very kind and a great listener, this was all too much information, but I listened and nodded because he was helping me with finances.  When I left the first night after getting some of my information entered, I owed a boatload of taxes.  I was not happy and immediately began thinking of second jobs.  Barnes and Noble has been on my list for a while, but do I really want to work for a corporate monster at the lowest level?  OK, I'm a teacher, I really don't have much of a choice.  The next night was more promising, well financially at least.  When I walked in, the older man welcomed me and asked some more questions about my paperwork and then said he found a mistake the previous person had made that would save my taxes and actually grant me a return, a small one, but at least it was on the positive side.  I was ecstatic.  The clouds lifted and I would not have to sell my soul to pay my taxes.  He was quite pleased with himself as well and mentioned that he liked to see me smile more than three times.  I obliged him the smiles because he was, of course, saving my taxpaying ass.  This was a small outfit so all paperwork would be sent to a processing center to be checked and then I would have to come back to pick it up.  When I was ready to leave I went to shake his hand.  He held my hand well after the thank-you-for-your-help handshake and said 'The good news is that I get to see you one more time.'  I gave a quiet-I-don't-know-what-that-means giggle and turned and walked out.  As I left the store a scary thought went through my head, 'Did that old man just hit on me?'  He is not grandfather, really sweet older.  He's the just retired, wife just left me older.  Um, no.  I then began to think back to the conversations we had had over the past two nights.  Did he think there was more than accountant/ taxpayer information being past?    I have come to realize that I am clueless to men's flirting techniques, even when they are obvious.  This usually happens when there is no interest on my part and therefore why would I be looking for signs?  There was once the college friend who all of sudden told me he loved me.  I stopped being friends with him, pronto (I know, I'm a bitch, but he ended up gay so um, I think I was right).  There was a guy at a bar once who told me he had been staring at me and trying to pick me up for 1/2 hour.  I had no idea and I'm glad actually, he ended being quite cute and oh-so strange.  Then there was a guy at weekend long party who followed me around the whole first night until I realized after he told me that I was the kind of girl he wanted to marry that I really needed to just be around my girlfriends.  I hate those clueless girls, the ones who have guys swarming around them while they are supposedly oblivious.  I guess, sometimes we all are That Girl.  Regardless if the old tax-man was getting flirty or not, I can't help but feel that my tax refund is now just dirty money.          "

She was 5 years old, skinny with blond hair and brown eyes.  We were beautiful together, the little girl version of yin and yang.  “Let’s go together,” one of us said.  So we raced to the upstairs bathroom, got ready and sat down together to pee.  We were giddy.  This was silly.  We were peeing together, our tiny bottoms sharing one toilet.  Our mothers thought it was precious.  This was our cousin thing, a little girl bonding time.  One mother grabbed a camera and flashed our picture, B. with her long blond hair and legs together facing the bathtub, me with my long brown hair and legs together facing the wall.  We are squeezed in, our hands holding on to the tips of the oval seat so we wouldn’t fall in or off.

We are so different and so similar.  I am proud of her, that she is a brilliant photographer.  I love that she loves her animals and plants like they are her children.  I’m glad she has found a man in a fairytale way, which we always dreamed would happen.  I love that she is strong and kind and knows more than she tells.

3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       I  I don’t remember his name, but I remember the first time I met Autism.  I was in college doing a very short practicum.  It was, in fact, my first practicum.  I was placed with a special education teacher at a local elementary school.  Her classroom served kids of varying disabilities, but mostly kids with LD or mild MR. She practiced “inclusion” and this was my first experience with this hot topic in special education.  I observed her sitting at the back of a classroom with a small group of kids while the regular education classroom teacher led a lesson with the rest of the class.  “So this is inclusion,” I thought.  “This isn’t what I had in mind, but I could do this.  OK, I get it.”  But, I would do more than observe over my 3 short visits to that school.  I asked the special education teacher if I could help her.  I wanted to get in there with the kids.  They were, after all, why I was there.  She asked me to sit with a little boy and read with him to keep him occupied for a short while.  His social skills were strange to me.  He came to me when I asked, but never looked at my face.  His eyes darted quickly from on thing to another, mostly at floor or knee level.  He sat down with me on a couch in a corner of the classroom.  He was the first to open the book and he just took off reading before I could tell him what we were going to be doing.  I had no time to ask him about the title, the author, or the pictures.  I was amazed that he could read the book verbatim to me.  He was in 1st or 2nd grade and I knew his true reading skills surpassed his supposed ability.  I asked him questions as we read the story.  I wanted him to explain or expand on the pictures in the book.  His answers were “yes” or “no” if anything.  Mostly he ignored me.  It seemed he had no idea what we had shared together.  I remarked to his teacher later that I was very impressed with his reading, but wondered about why he couldn’t or didn’t answer my questions.  The teacher was busy and couldn’t quench my inquisitions.    I was so uninformed and inexperienced with Autism.  That teacher couldn’t have told me the answer to my questions.  Like Autism itself, the answers were complex.  II Mathew was four years old and on the flyer he had an angelic face with blond ringlets framing big blue eyes.  I answered the ad for a home-based teacher and began doing ABA therapy with Mathew in his home for 6 hrs. a week.  It took me only a few days to fall in love with him.  “This is good work,” I thought.  “This is what I was meant to do.”  I had another job that year in college working in the merchandise department for a famous band.  While I took phone orders and packed t-shirts all I could think about was Mathew and how the work with him was far more important than satisfying the sticker and CD wishes of teenagers.  I was anxious to stop working for the band and when summer ended I split my time between classes and Mathew.  I learned ABA well enough to do it in my sleep.  “What number? What letter?, Good job!, No, try again.” ran through my head, my dreams were flooded with discrete trials.    I worried about Mathew and whether I was really being effective.  I explained to friends and family that my work with Mathew was tedious.  I tried to put what we were doing into everyday language.  I said “We’re trying to introduce him to our world, one thing at a time.”  I don’t think my friends really grasped the idea, their puzzled faces said more than their encouraging words.  They feigned enthusiasm for my sake.  This was becoming my passion.    After a full year with Mathew I was tired of ABA.  Our sessions had become the same, the same drills, and the same goals.  I was bored.  I can’t imagine what Mathew was feeling.  He was making progress, but not enough that I could make sense of it.  I had seen one major improvement in him.  I told my parents one night during dinner on their drive through my college town that Mathew had made gains and I was so excited.  I was seeing that he was understanding what we were teaching him.  The example I gave was this:  Everyday when I see him I say “Hi Mathew,” and he answers “Hi Anna” usually with a flat affect and no eye contact.  I then say, “What are you doing?”  And there is silence.  I prompt him with “I’m sitting, I’m playing Nintendo, I’m reading a book, I’m watching TV, I’m eating…” He repeats my answer and I say “Good job” and we get to work.  We’ve done this a thousand times.  It’s just the way I greet him, nothing specific we are working on.  Then one day around the 7th month into my work with him I walk into his room and say my stock greeting “Hi Mathew.” “Hi Anna,” he says.  “What are you doing?”  “I’m bed,” he says quietly.  I stopped in mid-stride then I flew to him, picked him up, threw him in the air saying, “That’s right, you’re ON THE BED!  Good job!  I love it!”  I tickle him and we repeat the sequence, me shaping his words with a prompt. “I’m ON THE bed.”  This was a good day.  This was important.  He was understanding.  I would later learn in my education classes that Mathew had generalized the information we were teaching him.  He was “getting it,” but I was happy for the reprieve and change of pace that student teaching brought when I had to stop working with Mathew.  I continued to baby-sit and stay close with the family, but this was my last experience with hard-core ABA.  It was the foundation for my obsession with Autism.  It was a good learning experience.  It was important.  III  The first day of my student teaching I knew things would be very different for me.  This was a TEACCH classroom.  What I walked into was a mess, a scattered and colorful maze of bookshelves and desks.  The teacher and TAs were just putting everything together after a summer off.  There was a relaxed feel and yet there was so much to do. The teacher was a graying hippie who wore overalls and Birkenstocks, drove a red pickup truck and talked about her horse, Nelly.  She’d developed the classroom and program with a fellow teacher.  This was her baby.  She knew Autism backwards and forwards.  She was wise.  I knew I’d learn from her.  And I did.  The first day the kids arrived, 8 of them in all, I stood and watched and followed, mostly with my eyes and mouth wide open.  These kids talked in full sentences without prompting, the cared for their own belongings, they followed their own schedules, they played with typical peers, they asked for help, they were toilet trained.  “This is not Autism,” is all I could think.  I talked with the teacher that first school day when all the kids had left.  I had a million questions about each child.  “Why is Ethan so lethargic?  If Sadie didn’t talk when you first met her, how did she learn to talk?  Will Kathleen ever read?”  I knew I had to get used to fact that Mathew was not Autism and Autism was not Mathew.  That classroom proved the spectrum for me in terms of kids, in terms of methodologies.  Autism is a rainbow of colors, I got it.  IV Anthony’s parents came to school before school even began.  We had to amend his IEP.  He was switching schools to my newly formed Autism classroom and he would be held back in kindergarten for one more try.  His mother and father were originally from India.  They spoke English, but I still found myself speaking loudly and repeating things in simple phrases.  I needed to feel that they understood me because I couldn’t understand them.  Anthony’s first day in my classroom for kids with Autism was my first day too.  We both had no idea what we were in for.  Anthony would spend half a day in kindergarten sharing a TA with another student and half a day with me working academics and adaptive skills.  Anthony worked hard and was rewarded with playtime.  He spent a lot of him playtime having figures interact or simply talking gibberish to himself.  He knew English, but would only speak when prompted.  His parent assured us that they only spoke English at home.  This was important for him to learn one language given his challenges.  His parents were adamant and I believed them, they didn’t understand him very much either.  He made no eye contact unless I cupped my hands around his big beautiful brown eyes and put him face to mine.  Anthony was a puzzle and he worried me.  Then, we began to acknowledge his sounds and anytime he used an English word appropriately we threw a small party.  Soon Anthony was throwing his own parties.  He would show us his artwork enthusiastically exclaiming, “Look.  Oh it’s beautiful.  Good job Anthony!”  When he would answer a question he would automatically congratulate himself, “Yes, good job!”  We would agree with him and then laugh with him.  We knew he was repeating us, but we couldn’t have paid for that pride or that growth.  We took it and embraced it, Anthony was awakening.  Slowly and surely Anthony made strides.  He quickly learned to read alongside his peers.  He was counting and making patterns.  His comprehension was always a bit of a challenge, but by 3rd grade he was working on grade level and fully included in his regular education classroom.  He even had friends.  Anthony was an exception.  He was bright and his parents worked with him constantly.  He is only one of many success stories, but his is one I think of often in terms of extremes.  His speech pathologist would often say to me when I was discouraged,  “Anna, when we tried to evaluate him his first year in kindergarten he was a mess.  He would sit in his classroom in the corner, rocking and saying gibberish.”    Turns out, there was no gibberish there, just words that needed shaping and a little boy who needed lots and lots of encouragement and laughter.  We happily gave it to him.   V  Autism is a neurological disorder that stems from deficits in social and communication skills and coincides with repetitive behaviors.  I often speak of Autism’s umbrella, how ADD and OCD and MR can all be part of a child’s diagnosis, but I always feel I fall short when explaining the true nature of the disorder.  This is hard for me because I can’t possibly relay all the stories and images that had led to my understanding and yet without those stories and images my understanding is weak.  I want people to automatically see what I mean when I try to describe how this disorder can present itself and I am so careful that I don’t leave a Rainman image, a one man show of a multi-faced disability.  I think I always fail; Rainman is more visual than my words can ever be.  And this too is what frustrates me when trying to explain my philosophy in educating people with Autism.  Contrary to my beginning with this disorder, I believe in a highly eclectic approach filled with speech therapy, occupational therapy, sensory integration, floortime, inclusion, schedules, behavior plans, varied opportunities, generalization, varied teaching materials and methods, all under a child centered, extremely structured environment.  And above all I believe in spontaneity with these students.  How can you be spontaneous in a highly structured environment?  Easy, make sure the structure allows for freedom and the kids will blossom.          "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       I see the skyline of New York and my stomach does flips.  I want that city.  I crave that city.  When I unexpectedly come across a picture of New York’s skyline, I take in the scene and then have to look away.  I can’t look too long because the stomach flip will turn into an aching.  So, I move on and begin to plan a trip back to Gotham.   I’ve only visited on short trips.  Sometimes my visits were so brief they were merely a tease.  A one-nighter for a private concert, a one-night lay over to the Dominican, and a lunch on Spring Street in January with snow falling while passing through town.  No matter the time I’ve spent in NYC, the city is always with me.    This past December I told my friend shortly after we emerged from Penn Station that I just felt at home in the city.  There is so much life in New York and this is what I love must about it.  Of course there is life everywhere, but in NYC it is at its most vibrant.  I love that there are people crashing into you on the sidewalks.  I love that you can hear the streets and sirens at 4am on the 25thfloor of an apartment building.  I love the subways and buses carrying strangers to a million different places.  I love that there is a giant patch of green in the middle of the chaos to offer a reprieve and that inside that escape the skyline still impresses its buildings, gesturing to come back into the fray.  I consume as much media related to New York as I can.  I watch every documentary I find, rent movies with that take place in New York, read books with NYC as the setting, and read blogs of NYC dwellers.  Obsession would be a good word for it, but my fascination is more of a hobby.  I think about moving there and then life goes on and I forget about it or convince myself that it’s not really what I want, that I need to cultivate the roots here and stay near my family whom I love.  But, when I see a picture of New York’s skyline, my stomach tells me to go back to the obsessing, to get online and find a job and an apartment in the city, to forget the ties in Virginia and to make that leap.  I know, I know.  Why not?  Well, I have no answer.  All I can say is give me a year, we’ll see.          "

3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       At one point during every season, save for summer, I think that this season is my favorite time of the year.    I love the point in fall when the leaves have turned their autumnal colors and there is a crispness to the air that only happens in late September and early October.  Fall smells like new backpacks and fresh notebooks.  For me, fall signals beginnings though most of nature is ending or falling into a slumber.   Winter brings the snow that quiets and cleanses everything under its blanket, and this usually brings rest from the harried school days.  I love the cold and chilled air of winter, sleeping under a thickly feathered duvet and throwing on handmade scarves to snuggle my neck.      My favorite thing about spring are the honeysuckle flowers.  Spring sneaks up on me every year.  I grow use to the barren trees of winter and somehow don’t notice the buds and tinges of green that Spring pushes through.  Then one day, all of a sudden, there are no more branches on the trees, hillsides cascade with green, houses are hidden behind rows or clumps of leaves and flowers, and shade gracefully covers the precious areas under the trees' new dress.    But, honeysuckle.  It's an amazing testament of re-growth.  It grows wild along highways, alleys, schoolyards, and backyards, any place with a fence to lend climbing space.  The bushes are everywhere and when a small honeysuckle breeze blows and catches me off guard I am seven again, standing in my front yard on the left side of the house near the alley with my brother and neighborhood friends.  The bushes are full grown and you can't be outside without the sweetness luring you.  We would gather round the bushes picking the yellow and white flowers as quickly as we could.  We wanted as much sweetness as we could get, but we were hindered by our work.  Stealing honeysuckle juice is a delicate task.  You must be careful to pluck the whole flower from the bush.  Then gently holding the flower midway up the petals between two fingers on one hand, you pinch the bottom green mass between two fingers on the other hand and pull.  The pulling must be slow.  You must feel the tiny yellow ball at the end of the delicate stem slipping through the petals, grabbing and pushing the honey out of the small hole you've made in the flower.  Then quickly move the flower and stem to your tongue a moment before you pull the stem from the flower and feel the tiny tickle of sweet, watery honey.  It's spring.  Your tongue has confirmed it.  Life is beginning again.            "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       I was strolling through B&N one day and noticed that in the SAT prep section there were new materials, which were not part of my SAT study path.  I had a tinge of jealousy seeing 'SAT word' novels on the shelf.  The titles like BUSTED and HEAD OVER HEELS accompanied cheesy cover art and promised stories of love and mystery among high school students.  These 'novels' are written around common vocab. words found on the SAT and those words even appear in bold type within the text.  I was jealous because even though I have a BA in English Lang. and Lit. and love to read, I hated and struggled with reading throughout elementary, middle and high school.    My majoring in English was a surprise even to myself because I entered college loathing reading and writing.  I even went to the writing center on campus to get assistance with my early college papers and I would come out knowing I had much work ahead of me.  I was originally going to major in Psychology thinking that I needed this background for teaching.  But, my heart was never in Psychology and when one of the best professors I ever had gave me a C, it pushed me to make a change.    He was one of the best professors, not because of his teaching, but because of our talks during my office visits.  I went to him often for help because I was failing his class.  He became my friend and gave me guidance.  I learned about his family and his struggles in college and he helped me see that my world was not, in fact, collapsing around me.  We didn't talk much about the class I was taking from him, these were more like therapy sessions.  The strange thing about his role in my life that semester (and even later when I would go and visit with him) is that his specialty was in learning and cognition and he worked primarily with mice.  He wasn't trained for the sessions we had and when he handed me chemwipes as I cried during my first visit, I knew he would be my friend.    After a few sessions in his office, the semester was ending and it was time for the final exam.  I rocked the socks off of my final, but he still gave me a C for the course, I was one point away from a B- and passing the class.  I was heartbroken and felt betrayed. When I went to see him after winter break to discuss my grade, he didn't flinch although he had previously and quietly said he would help me if I made a good enough grade on the final.  I left his office quietly and quickly that day, there was no therapy session to work me through this one and I wasn't that upset, surprisingly.  He knew what he was doing; he knew my heart was not in Psychology.  With the threat of having to retake that Psychology class to finish the major looming in the distance, I went on with my other classes.  While studying THE EPIC OF GILAMESH for an anthropology class with a friend, I realized I had to change my major.  I loved the analysis of psychology, but I hated the science of it.  English, this is where I could find the analysis I craved without any science to confuse my brain.  I crammed every English class available into my schedule.  I stuck to mostly poetry classes as I thought this was my passion.  I think part of me really liked how short poems where.  I was still a little afraid of all that reading.  But, I couldn't avoid it forever and I'm so glad that I had to read books like A RAISIN IN THE SUN, AS I LAY DYING, DROWN, NATIVE SON, CYMBELINE, THE COLOR PURPLE, and THE BLUEST EYE.    I wasn't the best at reading all the assigned readings.  'Sir Gawain' and Chaucer didn't excite me and there were Colonial American passages that put me to sleep, literally.  I still struggle with my love/ hate relationship with reading.  I wish I were voracious at it.  I think it's partly that it takes time for stories to unfold.  I wish I could finish books in one sitting like a movie, but I read slowly.  I read every word and say each one silently in my head.  I know there are speed-reading methods, but I don't want to skip over words, I just wish I could read every word, faster.    A few years ago, I started a book journal where I write character maps and synopses of the books I read.  It's an idea from my 10th grade English teacher and I find it good for me.  I have physical proof that I've read a book and it jogs my memory if I can't remember a plot line or character details.  In the beginning of the journal I noted words I needed to look up, big words not in my daily vocab.  This lasted for about 3 books (OK just 1 really) and then the words I didn't know disappeared from the entries as if I've mastered the English Lang.  Hardly, I just got lazy, realizing I probably would never use or see those big words again and just began to skim over them.  But, sometimes, I crave bigger words in my head and I wonder if I read 'SAT vocab.' novels, would I cognize the context clues, ascertain the definitions and ameliorate my conversations?  I doubt it.            "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       Tonight going to my good friend's house to watch the finale of friends (um finally, thank God) I was driving to the middle of nowhere.  I hate the suburbs and she and her fiance live so far out that it takes 30 minutes and $2.50 in tolls roundtrip from my apartment in town.  So driving, I saw this mini cooper with the license plate 'SUVS SUC.'  Now, I know we guzzle gas and are ruining the ozone, but I really wanted to pull his little mini ass over and challenge him to play chicken with my SUV.  I'd squash him.  He'd be like a crumple soda can after slamming into my Sport (luxury) Utility (hauling shoes and pretty purses) Vehicle.  So, you mini man, watch who you're picking on.   And my best friend is getting married and sometimes this makes me cry.  Like tonight, it finally hit me and I cried.    PS-  I love mini coopers, being obsessed with all things British.  But, don't mess with my SUV!         "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       Of course I've thought about it happening.  I've envisioned how it would happen and what I might do.  I've considered that I should devise a plan if it happened, just to be prepared.  Well, it happened and I had no plan, no diagram to show me what to do.    This morning I woke up with a headache thinking, as I do every morning, that I just want to get back in bed, I want to call in sick.  But, I never do call in sick.  I turn on the coffee maker, get dressed, fix lunch and when the coffee is ready I begin sipping it while quietly saying a prayer that my empty stomach will except the legal stimulate and take it straight to my brain.  This morning, the coffee couldn't work fast enough and the headache required 2 ibuprofen.  Praying to the over-the-counter drug gods that the medicine too would go straight to my brain, I began looking for my keys.  I couldn't find them and my head hurt too much to search really hard.  So I grabbed the spare set with it's spare car key, spare car remote clicker thing, and spare apartment key.  The clicker thing was the slightly used one I had traded for the unused one a few months ago thinking that the battery in it had run it’s course.  It's a sad little keychain with only the three danglers, but it would have to do, I was running late.    It was a wet morning and this time I remembered my spare umbrella in case the heaven's opened up on me as I went from school to school.  I stepped out of my apartment, coffee in hand and as I approached my car, the spare clicker wasn't working.  I figured its tiny battery was in fact dead and opened the driver's side door with my key.  I then tried to manually unlock the rear doors by using the power unlock button on the driver side door (I know, not really manually).  Nothing happened.  I was confused.  I hopped in, put my bags on the passenger seat, set my coffee in its holder and put the key in the ignition.  Upon turning it, I got nothing.  I mean nothing, not even the usual piddily sound the altenater makes when it’s trying to charge the battery when in fact the battery is dead.  All signs were pointing to a dead battery, but no noise, that was strange.  I was confused and then remembered how the ignition had been acting funny the last few days.    Here is where I needed the plan and had none.  I first said a quick thank you to God that I was a support teacher and did not have a classroom full of kids waiting on me and then a bit of panic set in.  What do you when you are almost late for work as it is and everyone you know is probably at work already.  I called my brother, he had to take the kids to school and even if he could get me to work I couldn’t travel to my other schools and I'd have to take care of the car today anyway.  So, I had to call in.  I was getting my early morning wish, but really, this was not the way I had wanted it.  Having no plan I couldn’t figure out how to call in: Do I call in sick or is this personal business?  Do I call in for a half day and hope my brain clears and I figure out how to get to school for the last half of the day?  Who can help me?  How long with AAA take?    I ended up calling in for the whole day.  Car troubles have notoriously taken whole days before so I thought I would play it safe and not confuse the day even more by having to try to get to school by a certain time.  It all worked out.  The dealership was able to (expensively) fix everything by the end of the day and I can go to school easily and safely again.  I'm just wondering, do you have a plan if it happens to you?          "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       This past weekend I went to Winston-Salem, NC to a cousin's wedding, on my dad's side.  I am not close to this side of my family; my dad having only brothers and brothers are less likely to gather their respective families together often enough for children to form bonds.  I do see my cousin A. every Thanksgiving at our house though I don't really know her.  She is, however, sweet and kind and so I was happy to go to her wedding.  I was, however, happier to also spend time with my Cousin Loves A. and R. from my mother's side.  My mother has two sisters and while both live in different cities in North Carolina, all of our families have grown up together.  We have spent almost every holiday together, camping vacations at the beach, and weeks at Lake Norman, NC.  My cousin's and I (a total of 3 girls and 1 boy) haven't always been great friends, but we were great playmates growing up.  We were around each other so much that it seemed like we were brothers and sisters.  We played, we fought, we played again, and then we went to college.  When we grew older we became friends.  Trips to visit each other and weekly phone calls developed.  We became good friends, we were happy our mothers brought us together, we were happy for our Cousin Love.  Cousin Love is how we address each other and we do it with a southern drawl.  It ends up sounding like 'cuzzin luuuuv.'  It is merely a way to say, 'I'm glad you're in my life.  I'm glad you’re my cousin and I love you.'    Cousin Loves have begun to multiply.  There are now wives and soon-to-be husbands and I'm sure there will be children soon too.  We welcome the additions and affectionately extend the Cousin Love name.  Our children will continue to be cousins though growing more and more distant in a familial since.  We know they will grow up together, we hope too that they will develop innocent Cousin Love and see the joy of friendship that we have.  We have a tentative plan to save our monies and buy a beach house.  We want to name it Cousin Love, but know that the world would think us odd.  So, in Spanish it would be 'Primo Amor.'  And in Italian, it also means 'first love' and this sounds good to us.  So, this past Friday night, after the rehearsal dinner for A.'s wedding I took my newly found cousin from my father's side over to A. and R.'s house for some quality time.  It was fun, good drinks, good conversation.  It was like we had all been friends forever.  It was what Cousin Love is all about.  And my cousin R. from my dad's side blended right in.  In fact, we've convinced her to come to Thanksgiving this year, to continue and expand the Cousin Love.  The Cousin Love was so good I felt full up, full up of the kind of love that lets your know you have all you need in the world.  The next night at A.'s wedding I sat with my mom and dad, my dad's cousins, one of my dad's brothers, and my cousin R. as we watched A. and B. swish around the room.  They did their prescribed wedding things: the first dance as husband and wife, the father-daughter dance, the cake cutting, and the throwing of the garter.  As I watched them cut the cake I felt full up again.  I felt no envy of A. and B. at that moment.  There was no sense that I was missing something.  I realized then that I love my family, I love my life, and I am happy.  Full up, indeed.         "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       How do we meet them?  When do we know they will be important in our lives?  What are the signs that certain people are meant to change you, permanently?    This weekend I found a good friend, and luckily, she is part of my family.  At our mutual cousin's wedding we met again after probably 15 years.  I don't even remember the last time I saw her but it was probably at our North Carolina family reunion, eating chicken stew cooked in a large cast iron kettle over an open flame.  Surrounded by family I didn't know very well and in the mist of teenage angst I guess I didn't realize what an amazing person R. would grow to be.  Funnily too, we lived an hour away from each other at one point in college and never made the trip over the mountains to meet.    R. currently lives in NYC pursuing her passion, poetry.  She’s been through college, graduate school and now another masters degree for writing.  She's lived almost a whole life since we last talked and I guess, I have too.  We talked about NYC and my passion for that city and about poetry.  We have more in common than I can believe.  She is someone I wish had always been in my life and she was, I just didn't know it.  The cousin's wedding whom we were celebrating was brought about through similar circumstances.  A. and B. had gone to high school together, but didn't run in the same circles.  They both went on to college and jobs and lived in various other cities then met again a few years ago while both were back in their hometown.  Their friends say that A. and B. are perfect together, they compliment each other, and that they are deeply in love.    Why does it take years, sometimes lifetimes to realize that people who surround you are the ones that will compliment you in ways you can't even fathom?  It is as if we are not ready at times.  Friends, lovers, husbands, and wives may pass us along the street, but until we have fully grown into ourselves, it doesn't matter how often we meet.  When we are ready, hopefully they will be there.  It's as if we are all just ships passing in the night and I'm so thankful when somehow we meet again and our lives begin a new direction.         "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       My parents are here.  They are taking care of me which is nice since the tetanus shot has ruined my left arm, I got a splinter in my good foot hopping around, and all of my muscles are sore from having to be used all of a sudden in ways they are not used to.  Anyway, enough of the moaning and groaning, I should be half-walking in a few days.    My family is taking me to the beach to be waited on.  I can’t go in the sun with the antibiotics that I’m on and I can’t get my foot wet.  It’s all good; I don’t like the sand and saltwater anyway.  So, I’m off for a week.  I’m being driven 4 hours to sit in a house and have people bring me things.  I’ll be knitting up a storm and reading and watching my little nieces and nephew play.  I wish I could play with them.  So, no blogging for a week.  Come back, I’m sure I’ll have lots to say when I return to you as long as you return to me.         "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       And it seems I should have stayed there.  The infection is way better today, but I was really groggy from the vicodin this morning.  I had to take it last night to sleep through the pain.  Then, this morning, I went to fix some eggs and toast and just when I was going to put the food on the plate I stepped on a blade that had fallen from a cabinet that I forgot about and didn’t see.  I sliced my foot wide open and now have 6 stitches.  I’ve never had stitches and I was not the best patient for the poor doctor.  This has been a rough two days.  I’m going to bed and please don’t call cause I can't walk to get the phone.           "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       So, I have an infection and from 6 to 10:45pm was in some SERIOUS pain.  I went to a prompt care place nearby and pretty much cried the whole time as the pain got worse and worse.  I thought about not going, about toughing it out.  I don’t like to look like a hypochondriac, but after phone calls to mom and the worsening of the pain, I couldn’t not go.  I’ve never seen any of the staff before and I went by myself so I’m sure the staff saw this crying girl and was like “Ok, what’s going on there?”  As they sent me from the bathroom to x-ray room to testing room and 2 people walked in on me undressing then dressing, I cried.  I cried around the nurse, the doctor, the x-ray tech.  I winced and moaned and squirmed like I was having a baby.  I’m not a crier and as a woman I can handle pain in the abdominal area pretty well.  I couldn’t stop the tears, the pain was too much.  So, after all the testing (and crying), the doctor on call gave me a bottle of vicodin.  I think he felt sorry for me.  I’ve taken the other meds, but not the vicodin yet.  That powerful a drug scares me.  And, thanks to the beautiful power of antibiotics (we are talkin’ serious ones here) and gentle Tylenol, I can walk and sit without moaning.  I love medicine.  I love doctors.  And, I’m sure if I take the vicodin, I’ll love you too.         "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       Yesterday, the phone rang while I was brushing my teeth.  Mouth full or foam and sonic still buzzing, I run around looking for my cell phone.  When I locate it deep in the depths of my purse I don’t recognize the number and think that I need to answer it quickly.   And then, like a dumbass, I do.  My muffled “hello” allows the person on the other end to identify himself.  While he does so I’m thinking “What do I do now?  I can’t talk like this.  Do I swallow it (ew) or spit while he’s on the phone.  What. The. Hell?”  I decide on spitting and just confess it, he’s already heard me sound as if I’m under water.  So I say “Hold on, I’m brushing my teeth,” then go to the sink to spit, sonic turned off but still in my hand.  I apologize to him when I return and hope that he didn’t hear me spitting in the sink, 3 feet away from the phone.  I realize; what a dumbass, like answering the phone at that moment was so important that it superseded the mouth full of water and paste.  What, what was I thinking?  Sometimes, I wonder.         "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       I’ve realized it is real work being a girl.  The maintenance is insane and usually I am not great at making regular appointments for the filing and plucking and cutting and tweezing and polishing.  I usually get things done on a whim or because I can’t take the jungle growing above my eyes anymore.  Home upkeep is far cheaper, but I am far from skilled enough to keep it up.  I try for a few weeks and then I have to revert to the professionals.   I’ve never really been the kind to have one hairdresser that I go to excusively.  A college roommate would travel 45 minutes back home to get her hair done and still goes to the same lady today though now the commute is about an hour or more.  I don’t understand that.  Sure, a good hairstylist is hard to find, but there are several out there, in every city.    I’ve never had a fear of the haircuts either.  I’ve walked into salons for the first time and told the stylist to just do whatever they wanted to do.  Some stylists like this, others, not so much.  I haven’t really ever had a bad experience.  One hairdresser said that I didn’t have to worry about my hair framing my face while other women used their hair to enhance their features and thus the anxiety they have.  I think she was complimenting me.  She also gave me one of the best haircuts and I ended up going back to her a few times.  In the 10 months that I've lived in Richmond I've had my hair cut three times by three different people, none were bad, but none were exceptional either.  Today, my stylist was Daniel, a thin man with spiked dirty blond hair who smelled like cigarettes and herbal shampoo.  I was apprehensive at first for a man to be plucking my eyebrows and cutting my hair and then he spoke and walked.  There is something comforting about a gay man being in charge of your beauty needs.  I told him I just needed a trim and he guided me to a sink then said we’d do the eyebrows first so we went to back room with a comfy bedlike chair.  He worked on my eyebrows longer than most women stylists have.  He plucked the small thin straggling hairs at the top corners of my brows and only put the wax on once.  He massaged the areas wear he had waxed and plucked.  He relaxed me.  He took his time and care.     I was disappointed that he didn’t massage my head when he shampooed my hair.  I expected he was an extended massager, he wasn’t.  As we walked to his styling chair I wanted to tell him to do whatever he wanted with my hair, to put his spin on it.  As he was combing out I my hair, I wanted to tell him to be creative, do what he thought was best for my face.  I never did.  I sat quietly and watched the other customers.  He never asked how much I wanted taken off.  He just took my hair and started cutting.  He cut it to a healthy length, parted it down the middle and added subtle layers.  He did this without asking or telling me.  He cut and cut and cut, the layers taking time and many head tilts.    When he was finished cutting he put straightening cream and hair gel into my wet hair and blew it dry using a rolled brush to straighten and turn the ends under, a skill I can never get down.  He didn’t talk much, nor did I, but when he did he said things like “rock and roll” and “twisted.”  With these words, I realized we couldn’t be friends.    Hours after meeting him, he lingers.  When my hair swishes or I brush it out of my face, I smell him, cigarettes and herbs.  In the time that I walked in looking for a simple trim and walked out with a hairstyle, Daniel became my hairdresser.  I’m committing to him like no other man.  I know at least he will take his time and care and he'll give me what I need without even asking.          "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       For week’s I have been wondering when exactly Father’s Day is.  I know of course, that it’s in June and on a Sunday.  But I feel like it moves around from year to year.  I have, however, just learned that it’s always the 3rd Sunday of June each year.  Hmm, I really have trouble with dates.  I’m horrible at birthdays.  Actually, horrible is probably not strong enough a word.  My best friend and I will often send birthday cards that are 6 months late.  But, we know that’s the way it is and we accept it, wholeheartedly.  Others, however, are not so kind.  I’ve known people to really get offended by others forgetting their birthdays.  That’s just damn selfish in my opinion.  I don’t know.  I’m not a big birthday celebrator and never really have been.  I’m trying to get better at it, but dates elude me.  Like today, I was reading my daily blogs when   urlLink Jennifer Weiner’s post  mention’s father’s day and I have one of those “Oh my God, I’ve got to call my Dad” moments.  I ran around looking for my cell phone and as I’m talking to my Dad I realize that I have not sent a card or anything.  I quickly realize I will try to remedy the situation next week at family beach week, but still shitty, shitty of me.  I sent my Mom a Mom’s day card (a day late of course), but nothing for my old Dad, who loves me so unconditionally.  Sorry Dad.  It’s not personal, I just suck.  Well, I guess in my case, we’ve established why there is no Daughter’s Day.  On the bright side, maybe the Father’s Day cards will be half-price tomorrow.         "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       Cellophane.  It’s my new favorite wrapping material.  I’ve just wrapped 2 presents for today’s scheduled parties and yes, one is wedding related and yes, I’m over it.  As I went through my quite vast assortment of wrapping material I landed on the cellophane for the first package because I had to due to it’s odd shape and then I just had to us the cellophane again for the next one, it’s just too fun.  And, while wrapping, I walked around singing “Cellophane, Mister cellophane” from Chicago.  And now, I’m just chillin’ before I have to leave to drive all over Virginia in one day.  I’m usually a last minute shopper and would typically be out buying the presents right now. But, I’ve learned to stockpile presents so that I can just pull from the bunch and go.  But, my last minuteness is not totally gone, I’m really waiting on my clothes in the dryer and I was suppose to leave like 5 minutes ago.  Oh well, people love me anyway, despite all the lateness and last minute presents, tags still on.  I am, in fact, not Miss Cellophane cause you gotta notice the girl who is fashionably late.

3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       Last night, at about 9:30 I had the bright idea of going to see “Raising Helen.”  Some friends had already seen it and since I had no work the next day I could handle to the late night showing at 9:55.  So, I hopped in the car and raced to the West End to the stadium seats.  It was me, and three couples.  Wonderful, nothing like smug couples on a Thursday night date.  Whatever.  I took my own row, settled in and put my feet up.  I love the movies.  I started going to movies alone about 5 years ago when in college an impossibly popular co-worker divulged her love of going to movies on her own.  I was appalled and shocked.  Why in the hell would a 20 year-old, blond, size 2, charming, and smart girl ever go to the movies by herself?  She explained that her mother did it and that she liked it.  She would often be shopping and find a movie on and just go.  I thought she was brave.   It took me a good year before I braved the movies alone.  It must have been uneventful, as I don’t even remember the movie that ended my solo movie going virginity.  Now, I don’t even think twice about it and yet I think I’m still a bit of a rebel in the venture.  I don’t think my friends do this.  I even have a friend who doesn’t like to rent movies alone. Movie watching is a solitary act anyway, unless, of course, you are at home snuggled up on a couch.  So, if a movie is out that I want to see and no one else does, or I’m near a movie theatre and see something interesting, or I’m bored at home and need to do something other than stare at myself, I’ll go to a movie, alone.  No big deal, it just happens.  So, last night was “Raising Helen.”    Sad bit of a movie if you ask me.  The plot was weak and lame and not well thought out.  There were scenes were I literally wanted to rewind and rewrite and then there were the ever present continuity issues where the clothes in one scene are the same in the next scene although it’s a different day.  This movie overall has bad writing, bad editing, and not really great acting although I still adore Kate Hudson, John Corbett, and Joan Cusak.  What were they thinking?  Anyway, good premise, just not well done.  And, I’m beginning to rethink things about my friends who said it was “so cute.”     And then, because I could, I went Wal-marting at midnight.  I stepped into the Wal-mart at 12:15am and spent the next 45 minutes shopping the supper center.  It was fabulous and surreal.   Tons of people were about, mostly Wal-mart workers restocking the shelves and a few customers.  There were boxes everywhere, which you had to navigate around.   The restockers would sometimes give me weird glances like it was crazy that I was bargain shopping in the middle of the night on a Thursday.  Please, like it’s not weird that you are working at Wal-mart in the middle of the night.  Yarn was had because well, the kitting has not stopped.  And then, because I could, I got some fresh produce and checked out at 1am.  Wonder if that is what Sam Walton envisioned for his supper store?            "

Since I had blistering sunburn 10 years ago, I have been cautious with suspicious items on my skin.  Turns out that melanoma does not necessarily strike the area that was burned (interesting).  And the mole or whatever seems to be nothing (thank God).  This was my first visit to this doctor in Richmond so I had to fill out all the info. sheets and sign away my life, literally.  Well, since it was the last day of school I had a little trouble leaving when I wanted to and then when I got to the hospital there was an unexpected game of chicken for the limited parking spaces.  So, I finally grab one and walk quickly through the soupy, muggy air (wearing jeans no less) and make it to the fourth floor about 7 minutes late for the appointment.  I get my papers and sit down.  I write and write and then pause to actually read the clauses before I sign them when the receptionist moves the glass plate that blocks out the waiting area (um, it’s glass people, we can still see and hear you) and this is what she says “Miss Banana, the nurse is waiting for you because she was expecting you at 3:30.  Can you write faster because you’re late?”  “Yeah, OK,” I say.  And then it dawns on me that I should have stood up on a chair or something and announced to the waiting area “Hi, my name is Anna and I’ll be late today.”          "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       I woke up early this morning to a fog, a thick fog over the city.  It nestled in the trees in the courtyard of my apartment building.  It was tranquil and quieted the morning like a blanket of snow.  I haven't seen a fog in years, probably becuase I sleep through them.  But today, the fog  mimiced the fog I've been under for the last few days.  Not a bad fog, just a mindless, in a daze fog where I leave important, confidential documents on a copier, don't put an important piece of info. into folders, can't comprehend questions asked of me, can't understand what I am reading. I've been in a haze but, now, it's mid-day and the fog is gone, the sun has burned it away.  It's the last day for teachers, my files are completed, I've helped other teachers clean up their rooms and mail letters home.  School is out.  We're done.  One year down, a million more to go.  But, for now, for the summer, I'm free.  Plans for the beach, LA, and NYC are being made, and of course all the weddings.  Happiness abounds with the sunshine raining down.  Pool days and sleeping in and reading books and unexpected trips and movies and relaxation and freedom.  It's good to be a teacher when it's summer in the city.         "

I decided to pick up knitting again this weekend and have so far knitted 2 scarves and begun three more.  I'm obsessed.  I even raced after school to a knitting store that closes at four so that I could buy way too much yarn for half price.  But, at least my friends will nice have nice yarn in their scarves instead of the Walmart brands.  I want to constantly be knitting.  I've even started knitting in bed with no lights on.  That's right, knitting in the dark, sexy.  And yesterday, I had to refrain from taking the knitting to the bathroom with me.  Knitting is on the brain so much that it's all I think about (at least for the last few days).  Like, when I'm at work or out with friends I keep thining 'I really wish I had my knitting right now.  I really want to finish that scarf.'  It's like I need a bumper sticker that says I'D RATHER BE KNITTING.  And no, there is no purling, just kniting and knitting and knitting.  See the obsession, it's bad and well, I need to get back to the needles and the yarn.   Tonight was yet another wedding related event, a surprise semi-shower for the friend and co-teacher.  Enough with the wedding stuff already.  The showers and the bachelorette parties and the girl's weekends and the weddings.  I mean there is no money left, the well is dry.  I'm really going to be weddinged out by November.  'Dear Lord, make me a bird so I can fly far far away.  Dear Lord, make me a bird so I can fly far far away.'

I didn't drink that much, although people were handing us shots all night, but those fruity shots don't have much alcohol in them.  And, I had my wits about me at the end of the night.  I was probbably the most sobber one there.  So, what the hell with the hangover?  Anyway, it's currently 5pm and I need to get on with my day, or what's left of it.           "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       It’s summer, well almost and not officially, but heat wise; it is summer in the city.  Poor Virginia, it is plagued with humidity and hot summers.  I know our summers are not like Texas summers or Louisiana summers, but they are hot enough for me.  I don’t believe in snootiness, but sometimes I wish I were a person who “summers” somewhere else if just to get away from the nastiness.  Maine, Maine sounds good, or maybe even Canada.    The only thing really good about the heat is that pools open and there are trips to natural bodies of water.  Every year my family takes a beach trip. I actually hate sand and saltwater, but I love the laziness of a beach week.  I take about ten books and I just read and play with children and read some more.  And then there is, of course, the eating of the shrimp and crab.  There is always the eating of the shrimp and crab.  But, before and after the beach, there is the pool.  Growing up we belonged to our local Elks Club, an organization I really don’t understand except that there were usually old men there at any given time throughout the day and they could be found at the bar inside the clubhouse.  I’ve never found out what the organization stood for or against and as soon as the last child (me) went to college, my father’s membership ran out.  We used the place for the pool and the pool only.  The local pool, a place where you learn to swim from the coolest man you have ever seen because he wears sunglasses underwater, where you strengthen friendships over adult swim breaks and during “shark” in the deep end, and where you tackle the fear of the “high dive.”  I never joined the swim team, but I was a lifeguard for 2 summers.  Lifeguarding is the best job ever invented.  Sometimes I think about going back to lifeguarding with my summers off, but then I think that the current 16 year olds would find me a bit strange and I would certainly not fit into their lifeguarding clique.  That’s OK.  I got my lifeguarding kicks back in the day anyway.  I just really miss the twirling, the twirling of the whistle while sitting in the tall chair with a high vantage point, the sun so strong you can see your legs tanning before you eyes.  The pool is now what I go to with my nieces and nephew.  None know how to swim yet, but I am determined to solve that one.  My favorite thing to do with them is to take each one, individually, in my arms and pull them across the pool from the shallow to the deep end.  On the cross-pool treks, our faces close together, we pretend different things, sometimes they practice kicking or just floating.  When water rushes into their mouth and nose I know it’s a 50/50 chance of them quitting the trek mid-pool.  But, the other day, my precious niece coughed it out and swallowed hard then said, in three year-old voice, “Annie, I want to ride the waves again.”  You see, we were pretending to be on the ocean and waves were gently bouncing us up and down (hence the water in the nose from the crashing wave).  I love the pool.  I love that it turns a three year-old into a chlorine swallowing wave rider.         "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       There is this guy I know, but he shall remain nameless, although I might be related to him.  I adore this guy.  He is one of the funniest people I know and whenever I am around him I know that we will be laughing so hard that we fall over.  However, last night I discovered he is the biggest dork I know.  And this is why.    We both love Apple.  We are both obsessed with Apple.  Like last week I emailed him about the new  urlLink Apple Airport Express  and he emails me back and is like “I was reading about it just when you emailed.”  And then the next day he calls me and we chat for like half an hour about how the world really needs to know that Apple is so superior and really people would be happier if they just owned an Apple and businesses were run on Apples.  We discover it is a futile attempt, but our love for Apple will never die.  This guy is a certified Windows programmer and even interviewed for a job at Microsoft so his love for Apple is even more special than mine.  He converted about 4 years ago and has not looked back since.  In fact, he’s a little pissed at people who like PCs.  He loves Apple so much that he gets magazines about Apple and somehow is in the loop of rumors about the new products they are creating. I know there are rumor websites and he probably surfs them.  It’s all a business related obsession since he programs all day. I have to confess that if I understood all that computer jargon, I would be in on it too.  I just don’t have time to learn all that stuff about computers, I just know I love Apple.  I also know that he is my Apple lovin' hero and he is there to dispense knowledge should I have a technical quetions.  He rocks my Apple lovin' world.    Well, so last night he was telling me about the last issue of  urlLink Mac World .    urlLink Alton Brown gave an interview and developed a special recipe to celebrate Apple.  The name of the dish is APPLE MACaroni and Cheese.  “Ew,” he said.  “Yeah, weird,” I said.  Then, this guy that I adore,went on to tell me that at the last Mac Expo (or whatever) when Steve Jobs gave his closing statement, he had a friend over to his house during their lunch hour and they watched it on the internet while eating MACaroni and then for dessert they had APPLEsauce.  Oh, dear one, I still, still, adore the hell out of you!           "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       Ronald Regan's body will be lying in state on Thursday at the capitol in DC.  I’m thinking about going.  Although I don’t really have the money to spend on gas, when will I ever get to see a president lying in state in the near future?  And really it’s not about the pomp and circumstance, it’s about Ronnie.    He’s the only president I feel personally connected to and it’s not about his politics or his cuddly nature and love for his wife or that even a president can be human and have family problems too.  It’s about birthdays.  You see, ole Ronnie and I have the same birthday.  Big deal you say, you also share it with Bob Marley.  But, Bob didn’t send me a birthday letter when he was president.  Ronnie did.  It was 1988, I was eleven and this was the last year for Reagan in the White House.  I thought my sharing his birthday was the coolest thing.  I had no idea what his politics where nor did I care.  I considered myself a Republican then because my parents were Republicans and so this extra kinship with Ronnie felt strong.    My mom had the brilliant idea of sending him a birthday card and announcing the importance of the shared date.  I was a little apprehensive, how exactly do you tell a stranger, much less a president, that you have the same birthday?  Why would he even care?  Well, we bought a card and wrote a note.  I’m sure my mom helped craft the sentence or else it would have been something like “I was born on Feb. 6 too.  Happy Birthday Mr. President.”   And, well, that’s probably what it did say.  So, off went the card and about 3 weeks later arrived a letter from the White House.  It was the most exciting day of my eleven year-old life.  My family was thrilled too.  I learned of his death on Saturday night after a full day spent with old college friends.  A friend was looking at the now framed letter on my living room wall and said that Reagan had died today.  “What?” I thought.  Then I thought about peace and that it seemed so expected and so natural.  I’ve dealt with Alzheimer's in my family and it is trying disease, on everyone.  I told my friends that it was probably for the best for him and his family.  Then I went to the letter.  He, or a staff writer, wrote a short and sweet letter.  It is typed on a typewriter.  The date is off-center from the letterhead and the eagle emblem.  It begins by acknowledging our “mutual birthday.”  Then, in presidential fashion, goes into the history of Febuuary birthdays including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.  He tells me to study these great men and hopes they will inspire me the way they have inspired him.  The letter ends with Mrs. Raegan joining him in his wishes and may God bless me. His name is signed simply “Ronald Reagan,” no mention of president anywhere.    We think he really signed it.  It doesn’t seem to be a stamp.  I will probably never truly know. But, it doesn’t matter.  My eleven year-old heart knows he touched this letter somehow.  In the bottom left hand corner is my full name and childhood address.  My name has a typo.  Since the beginning of the letter I have gone from Anna to Anny.  At eleven, this typo crushed me.  Now, it is endearing.  It makes the whole letter so much more real, so much like the man who’s birthday I share.     Dear President Reagan,  I am honored to have shared your birthday.  Every February 6 I will continue to remember your birthday and those of the other great presidents you mentioned.  Washington and Lincoln were truly amazing, but they don’t mean as much to me.  I can’t look over at my wall and see their handwriting.  I loved your letter and will always cherish it.   May you and your family find the peace you deserve and thank you, from my eleven year-old self and from me now, for all you did for our world.  Sincerely, Anny         "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       J. is a “military brat.”  She’s been all over the country and Germany, her family moving from place to place every few years.  Somehow she has roots in the mid-west and Virginia.  I’m thankful for those Virginia roots, happy they brought her friendship to my door, literally.  Ohio claimed her during undergrad.  She was a Buckeye.  I guess she still is.  I’d like to think she is more a Wahoo, but it’s not my choice who wins out.  The Buckeyes could probably kick our Wahoo’s football ass any day.  J. now lives in Austin and owns a home there.  Her settlement came by way of Miami and Seattle, her traveling childhood brought to the surface in young professionalhood.  She’s an audiologist.  I think she is resilient.  She lived 3 doors down from me in one of Thomas Jefferson’s original rooms at his University.  We had fireplaces, wood floors, a sink inside a closet, and a bathroom we had to walk outside to use.  Not exactly an outhouse, but close enough.  We were in grad. school, but J. was only there for one semester.  We spent hours chatting in our rooms, at night walking from room to room in our pajamas, outside.  When she left it was winter and cold, the freezing temps. had been lifted by fires in our fireplaces.  Our individual rooms heated the old fashion way.  J. was the best at making a fire that didn’t smoke the room out.    I was sad to see her go and begged her to stay, to change her practicum placement to Virginia, not Kentucky.  But her plans were made far before any of us moved to the Range.  So she left but came back for Foxfields and a New Year’s party in a cabin in the woods.  J. is a good friend.  She is smart, logical, sensible and yet just as neurotic as I am (well maybe not).  We talk about how much our lives have mirrored each other’s while she moved from state to state or country to country and I lived in the same pink bedroom for 18 years.    I’m so glad she stayed for that last semester.  I’m so glad she couldn’t find an apartment or dorm room for those few months.  I’m so glad we are friends.  And I love her couch or air mattress in her tiny cross-country apartments.  She’s an anchor in my life, a friend who will always be there and never feel that far away no matter the actual distance.         "

You need Emmylou’s mellow voice to match your mellow mood.  She’s not there, but you’re happy you find Johnathan Rice.  Put it in the CD slot.  The volume is louder than you expect but you don’t change it realizing “Quiet Hushed Voices” is what you were really craving.  Sing along to it with the sunroof open.  Don’t mind the people in the parking lot looking at you with bass flowing out the open windows.  Keep singing the words.  Park, knowing you are only pausing the moment.  Enter the automatic doors.  Pick up romaine lettuce and chevre.  A salmon fillet is a sudden passing desire; you grab it, and hummus, for snacking.  Check yourself out in the self-serve lane.  Get back in the car.  Turn the key and hit the sunroof button.  Keep the duet with Johnathan going.  Feel your brother’s bass in the floorboards and through the speakers in the door.  This is good music.

Head toward home, but pass it.  Make the right hand turn you make every morning on the way to work.  Bare left this time.  Take the toll road, the Downtown Expressway.  You need a hit from the city buildings; the skyline up close and 50¢ is worth it.  Pass Rosewood and the U of R Stadium.  Put Johnathan on repeat.  Slow at the toll booth until the SmartTag signals a green light to keep going.  Speed up, a horse out of the gate.  Get the center lane.  Pass VCU and the Cherry St. overpass.  Pass the 2nd St. exit and Thomas Jefferson’s Capitol building.  Go under a quarter mile of overpasses with lights burning a fluorescent tunnel.  Emerge to the buildings of downtown Richmond.  Wonder why so many lights are on.  Follow the signs to 95 North and 64 West, Washington and Charlottesville.  Curve around on the highway bridge through low buildings.  Look out the window, to the left, at the taller lit buildings.  {I want to love this city.}  Be amazed that you are driving so close to the bricks and concrete.  See the clock tower of the renovated Main St. train station on the right side, you can almost touch it.  Sing with Johnathan.  Get off at the Broad St. exit.  Go quickly through Shockoe Bottom.  Remember the recent attacks here.  Get back to 95 going South this time to Petersburg.  Stay in the right hand lane, curve right at exit 73C toward the Powhite.  Imagine you are not driving but are suspended, floating through these buildings, under the highway above you.  Look through the windows of La Difference.  Wish you understood the difference.  Go back through the tunnel of lights.  Pass the Jefferson Hotel and the Governor’s Mansion.  {I want to love this city’s history.}  Pass the exit for the Boulevard.  Quell the wish to live there in an apartment alongside Virginia’s museums and with a balcony.  Go on to Cary St.  Go to your home.  Park and walk to your building.  With the full moon behind say quietly and to no one 'I want to love this city.'  Unlock you door.  Put down your bags.  Wash you hands.  Decide it’s too late for salmon.  Get a large bowl out.  Pour the salad into it.  Begin to toast pecans from the freezer.  Crumble the chevre over the lettuce.  Pour on your homemade balsamic dressing.  Add the toasted pecans.  Take a bite as you walk to the living room, to your computer.  Realize you are a good cook, that this salad should be on menus.  Sit down at your laptop.  Put Johnathan on again.

I’m in the shade and leaning against the structure’s massive stonewall.  I’m on a pathway to a terrace though it’s a path that is almost hidden.  People have to navigate around me as they walk through.  I wish they’d go away and leave this public space private, for me only.  I can see a vast view of LA from where I sit from the hills to the oceans.  Ahead and slightly to the right is a small clump of tall buildings that make up downtown.  Beverly Hills is just below me.  There is a fire billowing on a mountain a few miles away.  It’s in Santa Clarita a passerby says.  The smoke won’t reach LA because the winds blow toward the east, toward the mountains.  It looks both ominous and soft, like a cloud.  To the left and over the hills from the Getty is the Valley and Pasadena, though I can’t see them I know they are there with clichéd houses and perfect lawns.  There is smog that hangs in the air between the landscape and the sky, a visible reminder of this cities population.  To my right, if I careen around I can see the sea and Catalina Island poking its head just above the haze.  The 405 are below me and the traffic crawls from north and south.  Planes line up in the sky ahead, waiting to land at LAX.  This city is huge, a massive gallimaufry of rich and poor, everyday and famous.  The rich build houses on the mountains or even cliffs, ignoring the impending possibility of earthquakes.  They look like cracker or thin wafers that could tumble down like rocks sliding.  California has it’s own style to everything, but the houses in LA interest me the most.  Their style is a mix of Mediterranean, Spanish, and American classic.  The rich, modern houses are minimalist with hard lines and lots of glass, but mostly there is stucco, tan and smooth.  It is the red brick of southern California.    The Getty is an amazing place.  , a free art museum, open to the public.  But, people don’t usually come for the art; they come to see the Getty.  It is a vast structure of buildings placed on a hillside overlooking all this city has to offer.  It is made of an off-white stone creating straight lines and curved walls.  The landscaping is immense, green, and perfect.  Fountains pop up in many places, an offering of serenity.  The buildings are so large that looking back on them from on of the many terraces and seeing people walking around on the balconies and inside through the glass, they look like tiny bugs, like insignificant, unimportant things.  People stand against the railings where I sit.  They squint and point trying to comprehend what they see.  The wind is strong at times on this hill.  They sun beats down an arid hotness, but in the shade of the building, a chill awaits.         "

She is a dear college friend whom I lived with for 4 years, 4 crazy party filled and chilled out years.  When I first met her I didn’t think I liked her because she is so honest that it can be abrupt at times.  Then, her roommate went home for an extended time due to illness and A. and I became good friends and I saw her kinder, gentler side.  I ended up staying in her roommates bed quite often because my roommate was a freak of nature and I just needed to get away even if it was across the hall.  I’m so glad we became friends and that she is in my life.    A.  is the kind of friend who is there for you no matter what.  She’ll be there to help you move in to your new apartment or celebrate you graduation a year after she celebrated her own.  She is honest and doesn’t judge.  When confronted with people who are quite strange she says, “it takes all kinds to make the world go round.”  We use to rag her in college because the words “my mommy says” preceded almost every piece of factual or advice laden talk.  Well, her mommy did a great job.  She is a great girl and a good friend.    She married a few years ago.  He is a boy who counteracts all that we college friends thought she was.  He is country and mild mannered and loves hunting and listens to country music and watches racing.  A. was a bit wild in college so when we found out her choice we were a little confused.  It turns out that the domesticated life filled with good cooking and family all around is really her true self.  Her in-laws love her as much as we do and she has found a niche for herself and her husband.  They are beginning to build a house on 20 acres of land in the country soon.  I tell her that as soon as she puts a pool in I’ll be there.  I bow to A. and P. land on this auspicious day and bid you a good one.  May tiny pictures from walmart decorate the halls.

Say some prayers people, may fedex not lose THAT package.  I've never lost my keys before and really it's not a huge deal though it may look like (WRITE it) like disaster.         "

3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       with another city.  I never thought I would like Los Angeles.  Never.  I thought I was an East Coast girl through and through.  Turns out, I could go either way.  Los Angeles isn’t anything I thought it would be.  It wasn’t as flashy as I had imagined.  It didn’t seemed as pretentious as it looks on TV and there was no preparing me for the weather.  LA was amazing and good to me.    I tend to fall in love with most cities that I visit.  Maybe it’s because travel is a carefree existence or maybe it’s because each city beckons to a different part of me.  Why did I fall in love with LA?  Well, it isn’t the rat race it seems to be or maybe I never came in contact with part of it.  And the sun shines everyday.  There are never clouds in the sky or rainy, mucky days (there are also not stars).  I knew this about LA, but I didn’t believe it.  My clouded East Coast brain couldn’t fathom endless days of pure sunshine.  How could you be sad in a place like this because whatever happens, at least it’s a beautiful day.    My love for LA is fleeting, though.  I know when I am home I’ll settle back into the humidity and heat and then the cool air of fall and the snow of winter.  I would miss the seasons if I lived here.  Endless days of sitting by the pool would begin to disorient me.  Life here would be like an endless vacation.  It would be like play, like pretend, just beyond the touch of reality.  And my love for LA is not true because it is shared with my love for London, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, and Morehead City.  LA is just another city to add to the list of places I could live if I ever decided to pack up and leave the state and family I know so well.  I never do make plans to move to the cities I love so much because I think if I lived there the magic would begin to disappear after a time and I don’t want that to happen.  I’d rather hold these cities in my heart as perfect gems nestled on hillsides or islands or by the sea, covered in fog or basking in sunlight.         "

I plan to do some touristy things and then just hang with my best gal pal.  I miss her and I’ll miss her even more when she gets hitched because girlfriends change ever so slightly when marriage happens.  I was hoping we’d hop over to Vegas for the weekend, but we’ve opted for time in LA with her fiancé.  Well, I love them both, loads and loads.  I’m excited to see them, either in a flashy city or just in their living room.  Have to say though, kinda wish I was going to see a booby show.  I’ll blog at ya next week.  Blogger back ya’ll.         "

We like diversity and we like to celebrate with our friends when they have things to celebrate.  Today is such a day!  Today is Bastille Day in France, a day of celebrating the end of monarchal rule.  And so, in honor of our French friends, a list of things we love from France, or things that France pimped out to us.  • the Statue of Liberty  • le baguette (yummy) • the colors of the French flag  • fashion  • le croissant (even yummier)  • Dijon mustard • Champagne  • Cannes Film Festival • toy dogs (because the French took them everywhere long before Paris Hilton was born) • Jaques Costeau • Les Mis (though in French it would be lost on me) • Jean-Marc Gaspard Itard and the wild boy of Aveyron • Matisse, Degas, La Tour, Cezanne, Monet, Rodin, Renior, to name a few • Joan of Arc • “Let them eat cake.”  This list does not endorse the loving of all things French because those French bastards didn’t go to Iraq with us so we said the hell with you too.  Our amazing and welcoming country forgot that French troops helped us in the American Revolution and about the gift that France once bestowed on us, the Statue of Liberty, and said, 'We’ll call French fries, Freedom fries instead,' ignoring the fact that French fries are actually from Belgium.  “Ha, take that you French bastards,” our government said.  Well, those French bastards were pretty spot on and had a sense that Bush was blowin’ smoke about weapons of mass of nothin’.  Damn those French bastards!  Happy Bastille Day everyone!         "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       The Shakers say it is a gift to be simple and a gift to be free.  “Simple Gifts” is an old shaker song written in 1848 and it is one of my favorites.  It is a song about simplicity, but it also says that “when we find ourselves in the place just right, we will be in the house of love and delight.”  While the house of love and delight sounds like a cheesy, incense burning, hippy joint, the sentiment is what gets me.  I like the idea that when we are true to ourselves we will find the simplicity of life which ultimately brings peace.    But it’s not always so such a simple gift.  We are all given gifts to some degree.  We are can run companies, we can cook amazing food, we can play an instrument, we can balance budgets, we grow a garden, we can teach someone to read, we can diagnosis symptoms, we can write, we can act, or we can see the world differently through the lens of a camera.  We all have talents and gifts which should be a part of our everyday lives.  The act of doing what you are good at, what you are talented in, is itself simplicity and freedom.    My cousin B. is an amazing photographer.  She has an eye like no one I’ve seen.  She loves taking pictures of things like rust and wood.  She can take scenery and portraits, but these are not her specialty.  Those shots are easy and generic, anyone can do them.  The passion she sees through her lens are things we would easily pass over.  B. hones in on the things that we feel corrode of corrupt surfaces.  Somehow, B. finds the beauty in them and she shows rust and corrosion as art.  And she does it so well.     She has never sold a photograph and has pretty much stopped taking pictures creatively when she left college.  All because the cost of taking and developing pictures is too much for her budget.  I’m saddened by this and I tell her often that she has to start taking pictures again, that she has to use her gift.  It is a gift to be simple and a gift to be free and sometimes we have to fight to use those gifts.  If our favorite writers and actors and doctors and teachers didn’t use their gifts, where would we be?  How many times has your life been changed by someone else’s gift?  I know that B. is scared and I understand it.  Putting your creative self out for the world to reject is a terrifying thing.  But that simple Shaker song says that  “When true simplicity is gain'd, To bow and to bend we shan't be asham'd, To turn, turn will be our delight, Till by turning, turning we come round right”  So bow and bend B., simply use your gift, you’ll turn round right.

3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       Numero dos is done.  Two weddings down, three to go.   The other day I received yet another wedding invitation.  As I perused the oh so familiar oversized envelope I wondered, “Who the hell is getting married now?”  I thought I was aware of all the weddings for this season.  Apparently now, but I was relieved to find out it is a second cousin.  I’m not close to her, so the pain of another wedding was lessened at bit.  It would actually be fine if I didn’t make it to this one.  But, it is in Florida in September.  Either that would be a great time to get a last minute tan or to see the wrath of a fabulous hurricane since it is the beginning of that season.  I don’t know if I’ll go.  It would really be a weekend of hanging out with the rents which, let’s face it, I do enough of in my own apartment when they decide to come visit, often.  I am; however, quite happy for this cousin as it is her second time of engagement though the first for actual invitations.  She’s in her late thirties and that alone gives me a bit of hope and room to breathe.  Tonight was a great wedding.  The drinks flowed and good food was served and we ate dinner overlooking a lake at sunset.  There were people I’ve never seen before and familiar faces from all the showers and pre-parties.  There were good friends and new friends and family.  And there was dancing and pictures and smiling and happiness and love, lots of love all around.   Starting at 3pm in a Catholic Church, I nestled in to back row pew and beckoned friends to follow suit.  Our row, full of teachers, was the official peanut gallery.  We could hear and eye everything from out backseats, the late comers, the whispers, the crying children, the brat child telling her mother to “shush,” we saw it all and yet WE kept quiet.     Not being Catholic, we were worried that this would be what my Dad likes to call and “aerobics class” service.  You know, up down, up down, kneel, up down, kneel, etc.  But, my good friend L. and C. decided on a Catholic light service since they too are Catholic light, if anything. The wedding was short and pretty with well-chosen songs and readings. The parish was beautiful.  I always love big, cathedral parishes; they almost make me want to be Catholic.      I go to so many weddings that I could probably recite the scriptures and the vows by heart, but this wedding did not bore me and when L. walked down the isle with tears in her eyes I kinda welled up myself.  I’m not a crier at weddings.  In fact, I thought for a long time that I had a stone heart because of my lack of crying at weddings.  Everyone else gets caught of in the emotions and you see women dabbing their eyes and bridesmaids pulling Kleenex wrapped about their bouquets.  I’ve never needed a Kleenex at a wedding and have always though “Yeah, it’s a wedding, what’s the fuss, why are you crying?”  But, today, for L., I understood a little more.  She’s almost 31 and the tears in her eyes were the symbols of her waiting so long for that man who loves and respects her and that she in turn loves and respects.  He’s not a perfect man, but he is one with whom she can share a life and so she cried for all that she is getting as she walked toward him.  And when I saw her crying, walking with her father, I thought of myself and if I ever find that man I’m sure then that my stone heart will certainly melt and tears will run down my face as I walk toward him too.    Cheers to L. and C., may you live happily ever after!         "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       So I haven’t been great at blogging lately, especially since I returned from vacation.  I even wrote those beach ones on vacation when I was up late at night and bored.  But, now back at home there are things to distract me.  I should be writing all day since I have no job, but I picked up a few kids to consult on and tutor so that takes up a few hours a week and then well, today, I’m just procrastinating.  I have my final paper due for a class that finished on Tuesday night.  The paper was actually due Tuesday, but she gave us an extension and I took it.  I am the worst procrastinator.  I will put things off until it is 2 hours to deadline, but this stress is really what gets my creativity and productivity going.  I’ve tried to be diligent and work on things early and it is so lackluster that it seems a waste of time.  I’ve tried to put my own deadlines on things to make me work on it and then go play, but no, again, I don’t fall for my own tricks.  So, today, I probably should have turned it in sometime this morning, but she didn’t give us a time and so I haven’t started.  But, now, now I’m getting ready to start.  It should only take two hours or so, unless I read some blogs, or turn on the TV, or have to call that friend back, or have to find that CD that’s been missing for 3 months because only THAT CD will make me productive.  Anyway, off to work on it, *wink*.         "

He lights up my face and makes me feel like I have the best life in the world.  He is amazing.  I’ve even met his family and they are amazing.  He has a brother and sister and his dad his handsome and his mother is kind.  They are calm and centered and welcoming.  On Monday, his mother gave me five ears of corn, just because.    This boy is undescribable.  It doesn’t matter what I write because you can’t possibly get the full scope of him.  He has wisps of blond hair and blue eyes and when he says my name I melt.  His personality shines even when he is in a different room.  He is sweet and cuddly and playful and so much fun.  And the reason that he lights up my day and makes me want to appreciate everything that I have is because he can’t walk because of a tumor on his spine and he has cancer and Downs Syndrome and he’s four years old.  He deserves to live until he is 80 years old with a life filled with happiness and productivity and good people all around him.  He deserves so much this little one, this boy that I met.         "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       Morehead City, NC.  On the Bogue Sound.  When you hit Morehead City limits you know you are at the beach.  Windows are being rolled down and the warm, musty salt air begins to hit your face.  Your hair begins to curl almost instantly.  You know good grits are on their way too because beach water makes the best grits.  You cross the bridge over the Bogue Sound and see a glimpse of that magical water, part lake, part ocean, part river, all saltwater and controlled by the tides.  There are clams and oysters and sand dollars and porpoises in this water too and you wish you were staying on the sound.  At the light after the bridge you take a right toward pine knoll shores, just a few miles away from Atlantic Beach, from you childhood.    The house sits in front of the ocean, facing what seems to be an endless amount of water.  You can’t believe there is actually something beyond the point that your eye can’t see.  The horizon is so far away that you see whole clouds from top to bottom in the distance.  Some nights, there are storms at sea, you see the lightning, but the rain and thunder never make it to shore.  You wonder what good a storm at sea does, were any boats caught in it?    Some days the wind is so strong on the beach that you have to stay in or go to the inlet or to Fort Macon or a day trip to Beaufort.  Some days there is no wind and the heat comes off the sand like it is willing you to leave.  Some days the rain comes in at lunchtime and moves you from your saltwater post.  Everyday, you want more, more sand clinging to your toes, more saltwater up your nose.  The ocean pummels and turns you out.  You keep going back to it.  In low tide there are tidal pools a short distance from the dune.  These are your favorite. There is enough seawater to float you on a raft and as the tide is leaving there are enough waves to keep you moving.  The tidal pool is the best of all worlds, no thought of a rip current and all the luxury of   On calm nights the moon glows in the sky so bright that the reflection off the water mimics daytime.  You swear you could see by it.  You know that nighttime is the best time on the beach.  The beach is yours then because no else ventures to the beach at night.  You sit on the deck and look at the horizon or the shape of the moon.  You feel like you have a secret that no one else really wants to know about.  How could anyone not love the beach more at night?  You don’t understand the fascination with the daytime, the sun and the rain, when the nighttime brings the moon and crabs and loggerhead turtles.  You know the secret and though you try to share it, others prefer sleep.     Soon you must leave the crystal coast of North Carolina.  No other beaches in the world will compare.  There is simplicity and elegance in North Carolina’s crystal coast.  There are very few trappings of fancy dwellings or pools seamlessly flowing into the ocean.  There are just beach houses, many are old, and some are new or just well kept.  But the house isn’t important, it’s the beach the matters.  It’s the weather and the sand and the promise of good shell hunts.  It’s suntans and bathing suits and rinsing off before you come inside.  It’s a morning swim then lunch then back again then dinner out.  It’s beach towels draped over the deck at the end of the day.  It’s the day’s catch on the pier or at the surf.  It’s floppy hats and sun visors and sunscreen and big umbrellas.  It’s rafts and buckets and shovels and sandcastles.  It’s enduring the grit of the sand and the stickiness of the water.  It’s the oldies station on the radio and it’s your family all around.  It’s the beach in North Carolina and part of you doesn’t ever want to leave.           "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       A rental for a week for your family, but a house to someone else.  The evidence of the family who owns the house is all around.  The selection of beach reads on the bookcase in the hall, a small sampling of games with missing pieces in the living room, pictures of the grandpa who worked his whole life to buy the house, artwork from local artists, and the choice of curtains that don’t match the furniture.  You enter a rental house like you enter a hotel.  You know it is not yours yet you will treat it is such for the next week all the while ever thinking about the family who calls it “our beach house.”    There have been houses that don’t lock things away.  The fishing pole of the grandpa who bought the house when he retired hangs on the wall beckoning you to use it.  So, you’re father does and on the first cast into the ocean he breaks it.  It’s too bad the original grandfather is dead or your father would have apologized to him.  Your whole family is a bit embarrassed, but your mother’s friend who rented the house said we were free to use the poles so your guilt is lessened a bit.  Still, too bad about ole granddad.  There are the houses that seem to want to share the experience with you.  They leave out a guest book and brochures about the area.  You glance at them.  There have been visitors from as far away as Ohio or as close by as New Bern.  Your brother calls the travelers from New Jersey and New York Yankees.  You call them Yankees too, but not out loud.  They tell stories of their weeks, how much their family loved the house, the good weather they were fortunate to have, and they note their favorite restaurants.  You wonder why they choose to write what they write.  The guest book is quaint, but you are happiest about the tide chart on the bulletin board, now you can start your vacation.    Exploring the house, you can’t believe that people share their space so openly with others that they will never meet.  The coffeepot and spoons and beds and pillows and sinks and bathtubs and deck chairs and lamps are all communal property.  There are fragile things about and when your niece knocks over a lamp and it shatters feel sorry for the family again, but then you think that the owner’s expect these things; beach houses are for children too.  You wonder how all the house was stocked.  Did the owner’s really like the dark, dense fabric on the overstuffed couches or was the whole ensemble on sale?  Did they pick up the appliances at a thrift store or are the leftovers from the family 1970s orange kitchen?  Your family discusses the flaws in the house, in the decorations.  They have ideas on how to make it better, what to paint or how to arrange the furniture.  You are quick to remind them that it is better than any of their beach houses.  Oh yeah, they don’t have beach houses.  No one is amused.    Some houses have a washer and dryer and this is a luxury.  You do a million loads in one week, more than if you were at home and partly just because you can.  You go home with clean clothes; this you realize is quite nice.  Other houses have a linen service and beds are made for you and towels are provided.  You feel a bit pampered by this, but you’d rather have the washer and dryer back.      There are houses with air conditioning so strong you end up with a stuffy nose going from hot to cold to hot to cold.  There are houses where your family breaks the AC and has to have the unit replaced midweek.  You are again a bit embarrassed, but realize you are just helping with the maintenance of the place.  Then there are houses with no air conditioning at all, just ceiling fans and the hope of good ocean breezes.  These are your favorites.  These remind you of camping in childhood.  This is what the beach feels like to you, heat cut by cool breezes off the water.  Days when there is no breeze you thank God for the invention of ceiling fans.  It takes a good day to get use to the heat and the breeze, but when you do, you don’t ever want air conditioning at the beach again.  You sleep in little clothing and one sheet, you like the simplicity of this type of house.    In your mind you are always building the perfect beach house.  It is oceanfront with enough bedrooms to house you immediate and extended family.  It is not new, it is old and well worn, and there is a lot of wood.  The oceanfront deck is partly covered and partly open to the elements.  There are rocking chairs and a hammock.  There is a table for eating and playing cards.  A walk stretches to the dune where just before the stairs begin there is another small deck with seats built in and a shower hose for rinsing off.  The house has most of its bedrooms on the first floor.  Upstairs, at ocean view and deck level, there is a family room and kitchen and dining room in one space.  There are many large windows.  The dining room table is big enough to sit 12 and there are folding tables for extra company.  You want your whole family here and you create a space that allows for it.  Couches in the living room turn into beds.  There is a good stereo with speakers throughout the house and the deck.  Oldies beach music is always on.  Every bedroom has a well-made ceiling fan and can be closed off to the rest of the house so that windows can be opened at night.  There are beach chairs on the deck and in the garage, waiting for the sand.  They are wooden with cloth backs.  There are rafts and lifejackets and paddleball sets and kites and bachi ball.  The house is always full of people.         "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       They wake up early in the morning to play together.  They are little girls with smocked dresses and bows in their hair.  They run around with high-pitched voices learning to share the toys they have brought, to the beach, to a family vacation.    Little girl cousins are a special thing.  They are automatic playmates and best friends.  They share genes and are beginning to share their lives, their growing up.  They clamor to the beach with all their might, they play in the sand for hours, filling buckets, dragging water from the surf, and hunting for shells.  They are adorable in their bathing suits and their skin tans easily even through super strength sun block.  Their fathers or mothers take them into the water and hold them safely from the waves.  The tidal pools are a perfect depth.  Rafts are their best toys, but sometimes it is just their hands and the sand and saltwater.  They get dirtier than they have ever been and never seem to notice the grittiness, the stickiness.  They don’t want to go into the house even after hours of playing, but they love to rinse off with the hose, a semi grown up shower for a little girl.    Watching your nieces you relive your cousin time at the beach, at Salter Path Family campground, on the Bogue Sound.  Your playground was the sound and your favorite things were floating on a raft on the calm water and clam digging.  You and your cousins where obsessed with shells.  You hunted them tirelessly throughout the days on the beach or at the inlet at the north end of the island.  At the end of the shell hunts, you surveyed your treasurer.  You memorized the shapes and names, the olives and whale eyes and baby cradles and cigarettes.  It is years later that you realize, browsing through shell books that some names were made up by your mothers, sisters.  The next morning, you woke up early to set up shop.  You took boxes your mothers had packed in, turned them upside down, and laid old towels on top.  You set out your shells by the side of the road in the campground.  You sold seashells by the sound.  You were thrilled with every purchase.  After a few days of selling, you and your cousins and mothers would walk the path of the campground to the real shell shop near the main road.  You were amazed with the polished shells.  You bought cleaned sand dollars and gold-rimmed hermit crab shells and rope bracelets.    Your cousin still loves shells and houses them in glass jars in her home.  You don’t need them around you anymore, but when you see shells or revisit the beach or see little girl cousins playing, you wish for the days at Salter Path, for the shelling and sound.  You wish for you cousins and you hope the new cousins will long for their beach days and each other when they are older.           "

Poor K has no idea what or who Stuart Weitzman is. “Sure,” she says and we enter.  The store on Rodeo is small yet two salespeople greet us at the door.  They actually talk to us and welcome us and tell us about the sale.  We have just come out of Ralph Lauren across the street where I found, but did not buy, a pair of purple leather mules on sale for half price at $495.  I knew Stuart could be much more affordable in department stores, but I expect the Rodeo store to have sales where shoes were still $200- $300.  I am wrong.  Every shoe on the sales rack is $75.  “Hot damn,” I think “I just might buy something on Rodeo Drive, baby.”    K and I try on several pairs.  I find some fabulous black satin high heels with an impossibly cute bow covering the toe.  K finds some strappy white heels that she considers for her wedding day.  We each buy nothing, coming back to the reality that even at $75 a pair; we don’t live a Stuart Weitzman life.  We leave, the salespeople shockingly bidding us a good day.  We are tired by this 2nd hour on Rodeo.  We have seen José Eber outside his salon, a woman clutching her toy dog in  urlLink Chanel , huge canary diamonds at  urlLink Van Cleef & Arpels , a rail thin blond model standing as a bored yet beautiful greeter at  urlLink Dior , and the back, private entrances to  urlLink Armani  and  urlLink Gucci .  We are heading toward the car, parked in the sun in a free space in front of someone’s small bungalow and perfectly manicured green lawn.  I am thirsty, having downed my bottle of water noisily in Gucci while walking among the fur trimmed dog beds covered in Gs.    We think we were done with the pseudo shopping and the mouth gaping staring and then all of sudden we walk across Plexiglas ovals in the sidewalk.  Below the “windows” were human size ant holes with manikins ironing or just posing.  There are three of them, two girls, one boy.  “What the hell,” I think.  K and I look above us and there is no sign, just a massive metallic rectangle as big as a Mack truck above us.  People are milling about in the opening to this, store?  The entrance is set back and it is all open, there are no doors, but there are two huge human sculptures with no heads resting just under the ceiling.  They seem to be holding up the second floor yet they don’t quite touch it.  K and I walk in, we don’t know what else to do, we are transfixed.     Inside there are concrete walls and before us a massive staircase that spans across the room leaving narrow “halls” along either side.  We walked down the left side and set into the wall there seems to be a concierge of sorts, a young brunette manning a phone.  “Is this a hotel?” I think.  Just past the concierge’s window there are low tables and set into the concrete walls are lit shelves at hip level.  Things are strewn about.  Bags, shoes, just stuff covering everything, but with no sense of order.  I look closely at one of the bags and see the distinguishable triangle with the word PRADA.  I turn, “K, we’re in  urlLink Prada ,” I gasp, my face looking quizzical and amazed at the same time.  K doesn’t say anything.  We keep walking.  We come around to the back of the room and there is another set of stairs mirroring the ones in the front yet opposite so that the staircases make a large triangle in the room.  We decide to go up, but have to navigate around shoes and the legs of manikins with no torso.  “What the hell,” keeps running through my brain.     At the top of the stairs we turn left and enter a room that runs like small hallways just above the space below so that on the right and left are narrow halls and in the front and back are slightly wider rooms over the stairs.  The walls are green and look like swiss cheese.  But, there are no smooth surfaces on the walls.  There are only holes.  I don’t understand it and I follow K’s hand to the wall.  It’s plastic, green plastic swiss cheese, “What the hell?”    The rooms are created with the swiss cheese walls on one side and glass on the other to keep you from falling down the stairs.  There are metal racks of clothes along the swiss cheese walls with exactly 5 items on each.  Thin, tan, bleach highlighted men in black walk around carrying an item or two.  They are barely noticeable in this room, the fade, into the…air.  When we turn the corner and hit the larger front room I spy the dressing rooms on the right side, above the stairs, I see two little girls playing inside, through the glass.  I think, “I know Prada is weird, but who tries on clothes behind glass, in front of strangers?”  Then, one of the girls hits something on the wall and the glass goes frosted.  “What.  The.  Hell?”    After I touch some $1500 mini skirts, we leave.  K and I don’t understand what we have just seen.  Was it real?  It will be the topic of many conversations with K’s fiancé that week and it will be the first story I tell friends when they ask about L.A.  I’ll say, “I’m going to tell you about Prada, but you won’t understand.”  And when I’m done telling them about the swiss cheese walls and the frosted glass they’ll say things like “Weird,” or “Are you kidding?”  And I’ll tell them that “yes, it sounds weird, but you still don’t understand.  You really have to go.  You have to experience it.  Go to Prada on Rodeo.  It’s worth the plane ride.”         "
3022585,female,27,Education,Aquarius,"01,August,2004","       I used to collect quotations.  I’d culled them from quotation books or magazines or friends or even the daily email from Oprah’s website.  I’d write them in a flowery printed journal in my best handwriting.  I wanted to the believe the lines like “Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see the shadow,”  but, Helen Keller never saw a shadow though she lived within one.  I wanted her words to show my how to not only look at the sunshine, but surpass it and become it.  She did, why couldn’t I?    For years my favorite quote was “We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.”  When I found it I thought Oscar Wilde was my soul mate, that he understood my plight.  I even wrote it in fancy scrawl across a painted wooden board that held a curtain rod and hung it over 2 different bedroom windows.  But, looking at the stars does nothing for trying to reach them and if you don’t come out in the daylight, the gutter must be a hot and miserable place.  “You must do the thing you think you cannot do,” wrote Eleanor Roosevelt and she was right.  You must in fact do the thing you think you cannot do.  She was strong and brave and I trusted her words.  She was the original Nike slogan, “Just do it.”  These words pulled me through many papers and exams in college, but nothing, nothing in college or life could prepare me for what lay ahead.  My first years teaching I was energetic and naïve and ready to take on the world.  I loved what I did and felt absolutely called to do it.  I thought that my teaching kids with autism was who I was.  I thought it defined me and that everyone should revere me for the work I did.  Those first years threw me into a tailspin of hatred and anger and bitterness and disappointment and fear and illness.  I complained constantly and to anyone who would listen, but friendships and life were slipping away.  Quotations and words of wisdom wouldn’t pull me through and there were many nights I just cried and prayed.    I finally sought help and through a counselor learned that my life was full of unhealthy patterns and that I was the only one in control of what could happen in my life.  I didn’t believe her and for 3 years cried and complained about all the things that happened TO me.  Then I began to use her advice and let the control go.  I had to learn to let go and forgive.  I had to learn to let life take me where it would.  I had to learn to do the thing I thought I could not do.  I faced the shadows and the gutters and I’m still learning to leave them where they are, in the past.  You can’t see the sunshine or stars clearly until you face their opposites.  And no one and no quotation will help you truly get there.  They can point the way, but you, you have to do the digging and nail biting eye to eye combat with all the bad things before you finally appreciate all the good ones and let happiness if not land, at least aim, at your doorstep, everyday.

Have a laugh my friends, it's better that a pill ( & this I know a little about lol) &nbsp;&nbsp; As &nbsp;I &nbsp;Mature........ As I mature I've learned that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is stalk them and hope they panic and give in. &nbsp;&nbsp;I've learned that no matter how much I care, some people are just assholes.  &nbsp;I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and it only takes suspicion, not proof, to destroy it.  &nbsp;I've learned that you can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes. After that, you'd better have a big willy or big boobs.  &nbsp;I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to others - they are more screwed up than you think.  &nbsp;I've learned that you can keep vomiting long after you think you're finished. &nbsp;&nbsp;I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, unless we are celebrities. &nbsp;&nbsp;I've learned that regardless of how hot and steamy a relationship is at first, the passion fades, and there had better be a lot of money to take its place!  &nbsp;I've learned that 99% of the time when something isn't working in your house, one of your kids did it  &nbsp;I've learned that the people you care most about in life are taken from you too soon and all the less important ones just never go away. &nbsp;&nbsp;Pass this along to 5 friends...trust me, they'll appreciate it.

That is, until I logged on last night and read the news..... &nbsp; A new man is now at the helm of Island records. At first I thought- so what? Just another corporate wonk to annoy all of us Lep fans. But after reading the article ( 3X, might I add) I've come to some conclusions. ( agree or disagree in my comments, I love a good debate!) &nbsp; 1- He seems to have come up the ranks from D.J.&nbsp; to Boss. This to me says he is a 'music lover', as opposed to a Businessman (accountant, paper-shuffler - you all get my drift, right?) &nbsp; 2- The fact that of&nbsp;ALL the 'established' artists that are managed by Island, He specifically mentions DL in the article makes me have hope!  &nbsp; 3- The release of LLWTG- FINALLY! Better late than never, perhaps. But if he liked the song alone- wouldn't he have released Lionel Richies version? After all, that would be promoting a record which has just been released- as opposed to one that has been concidered ' dead in the water' for a while now. &nbsp;&nbsp; Now I know that I may be 'blowing smoke' here, but I can't help feel that this is a good sign for the days to come. and the fact that our beloved guys are eligible for the 'R&R hall of fame' as of 2005 ( you all know how I feel about THAT- and if you don't , see my tag line on the forums!;-) ) Having someone like him at the helm of the ship may just mean smoother waters ahead for our band.&nbsp; JMHO- And you'll forgive me if I hope that I'm right on this one!

This bank I have my car loan through is supposedly a highly respectable institution, but the problem is they are based in North Carolina- NOT Florida! the closest branch of this bank to me is 2 hours drive.

I believe that the majority of us feel that some sort of war is eminent.  Maybe so, but where does that leave us civilians?  How do we support our country in our greatest capacity.  I work in a part (albeit small, but vital) of defense.  But being such a new member to this group, am I better suited for a military position?  I spoke with a friend of mine and she shuttered at the idea, although understanding my reasons…. I mean how could you not.  Our beautiful country is hurting, and she needs help.  I only hope that I will step up and help her in the most productive facility in my power.    So I have pondered whether the Army corp. of engineers is the place where I could do the most good in backing our great nation.  I am not the most physically adept person, but I consider myself fairly intelligent, and resilient.  Don’t get me wrong, I’m not running out tomorrow to enlist, but I am considering it, not as a career, but rather as an aide to America in its time of need.  How could I not?  When children are afraid of visiting grandparents, and grown men are afraid of what’s around the corner, action needs to be taken, and, as we’ve been told, it will be.    I only hope that they’ll take me…  I won’t deny my sexuality, but I do wish to help my country.  I’m sure many homosexual Americans agree with me in saying that we are hurting just as much as the rest of America (contrary to what Falwell’s recent interview on the 700 club may have referenced).  Obviously the future weeks will shed some light on this.      I attended a candle lighting vigil tonight at the Lincoln Memorial, and it was breathtaking.  To see all those people grieving was incredible.  To see thousands with candles is powerful enough, but to see them with our Nation’s capitol and most beloved memorials as their backdrop was immaculate.  It was inspiring to say the least, drawing upon those long since dormant feelings of patriotism that we put in drawers for days marked on the calendar marked with stars…  Well every day is marked with a star; it just took a little pointing to notice them…     Well, the stars are out tonight.

3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 Humor is my primary tool for dealing with various circumstances, but it seems that humor fails me in response to today's events.  I, as all Americans, feel saddened and enraged, but simultaneously guilty for having these feelings since neither I nor any of my closest friends and family members did not perish in these incidents.  I have lived, or in the case of northern Virginia: still live, in all of the areas that were unfortunately ravaged, and continue to have ties with their residents.  Thankfully my loved ones are accounted for; I grieve for those who are not.  Perhaps the most frightening thing about the occurrence as a whole is the horrific beauty in its execution and efficacy.  The poetic nature of the elements of the attacks chills me.  Today’s date, 911, already a pop culture siren of fright will ring more poignant in subsequent years.  While use of United and American vessels as tools of destruction will forever seem oxymoronic, for to me they will always mean peace and love.  Throughout the course of today I choked back tears mulling over how our dearest value, freedom, was literally and metaphorically removed when air travel ceased, and as Americans our wings were clipped.  It is times like now, and during tragedies such as this when I deplore my lack of faith…  But then I realize that I have faith, not in a higher power, but in my country, and in the nature of its occupants, my fellow Americans.  Faith that I AM living free and just, no matter what transpires.  Faith that, as an entity, our reaction will be swift: and faith that it will be just.  I gain comfort in the fact that we shall endure, and await the time when humor returns as my staple coping mechanism, but until then I just don’t feel like laughing. My love to all of you…  If tears could only repair the damage…              "
3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 Warning: If you know me and are friends with Erica, this is nothing new. (This is something I wrote for my friend Erica's site.  But that was before I had one of my own...  Ehh, shuttup I'm starved for material.)  Do you ever come up with something out of the blue... find it funny... and then analyze the crap outta how your brain made that connection? Well, I do... All the time. Okay I'll lay it out for you.  I have a problem with money... well, it has a problem with me. I mean it hates me. Soon after I make friends with the dead presidents, they file for divorce and go live with another, semmingly more fiscally responsible chap. And the main source of our irreconcilable differences resides on the street. See, I have this car... a nice bloke (Sargent Hughes is his name)... but he's about 2 or 3 times what I can actually afford. I catch a lot of flak from people about this. Maybe I deserve it, but I just joke it off.   So when people ask me if Mommy and Daddy hooked me up with the aforementioned cherry ride, I respond with, 'No, it was an impulse buy... I went in for milk and came out with a TT and a Chunky.' They quickly get a perplexed look in their eyes and laugh nervously.  But, the point of all this is the strange neural connection. Impulse buy and Chunky. So I got to thinking. Why don't people ever run to the store to buy a Chunky. Every once in a while you'll get an 'I need a pack of Cinnaburst,' or the occasional, 'Can we stop for Kit-Kats,' even those 1-1/2 calorie Tic-Tacs get representaion. So, why is it that the Chunky falls into the role of the red-headed step-child of the confection world. I mean, if you smell it does it not engulf you in a chocolatey euphoria? What do Milky Way and Snickers have that poor Chunky does not? Perhaps it's the name? Would more people go out of their way for a 'Svelty' or a 'Scrawny' bar? Maybe it's fear of that age old proverb 'you are what you eat.' In this age of perpetual dieting maybe there's no room for such sweet morsals. God Damn you, Dr. Atkins!  So next time you're in the express checkout lane behind some jackass who put both shitake and portabello mushrooms in the same produce bag in order to bypass that ever-so-strict '10 items or less' rule, look over at the Chunky but don't buy it. Instead, go home and write it on next week's grocery list in big block letters... I guarantee that you won't be disappointed. That square 2-by-2 package is cooler than the other side of the pillow. Just some food for thought... Or is it a marketing scheme? *cashes check for next car payment* PS... Does anyone even know what Chunky tastes like? I never had one of those MF bars. At least I know what my next pity purchase is.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Put down that Krackle and pick up a Crunch bar you Commie swine!  My previous foray into the politics of candy bars has led me to another of the industry's most heated debates. Krackle: Hershey's answer to Nestle's ever-so-successful Crunch bar, or Red propaganda aimed at American youth culture?  I heard at a party once that Krackle was the most popular candy bar in the Soviet Union when it made its debut in 1978. (Actually, I think I heard it from me, I was in the Mr. Knowsomestuff stage of intoxication, but since then, too many coincidences have augmented my concern) I don't mean to get all Joe McCarthy on your ass, but all I'm saying is 'if it looks like a duck... and talks like a duck... it must be a commie.'  Here's a little history lesson on the subject of the beautiful merger of milk chocolate an puffed rice. Nestle (the premeire confectionist of perhaps the most historically neutral country on the planet, Switzerland) introduced it's Crunch bar in 1938. Since then this texturial fusion of silky brown and bumpy white (sounds like a personal problem to me -e) has taken the bar candy industry by storm.   September 14th, 1978... Hershey shocks the nation with their new treat. The timing here is key. The subversive Reds would have observed a new generation. A guardless generation to which the 'Red Scare' of the 50s was nothing but a beddy-time story, and indulgences such as Disco and the Hula-Hoop were waning in popularity, making way for new guilty pleasures. The success of this bar was nothing remarkable to say the least, due to the late entry into the market. Krackle could not overcome the brand loyalty that 'Crunch-ers' (as they prefer to be called) have developed over decades. But did they care? No.  Since its inception, Krackle has cornered two niche markets that target American youth. The first of these is Holloween miniatures. What better way to distribute propagnda. The genius of this plan not only is exhibited by its success, but also in the lack of the public's understanding of their role in the spread of communism in North America. It's as if the Archbishop of New York was distributing fliers for 1/2 price beer night at a Chelsea gay bar, while filled with a sense of warmth that he brought happiness to the public. The second market that Krackle leads the way in is the coveted puffed-rice-and-chocolate-grammar-school-sales-contest market. Need I say more? Now, let's talk packaging... Upon first look, the red wrapper with white type may not seem too objectionable, but it provides for the strongest of all arguments on the subject. It's a little known fact that the original design for the wrapper had the word 'Krackle' in yellow, but this was thought to be too obviously likened to the Soviet flag. The broken text of the word is in itself extremely anti-establishment. Coupling this fact with the blatent disregard for the arduous process of teaching youngsters to recognize the hard as well as the soft uses of the letter 'C,' rather acclimating them to the Cyrillic alphabet's lack of the aforementioned consonant's versatility, exhibits the coldness of their plan.  Even with all this convincing evidence, Hershey spokespersons continually refute these allegations and deny the existence of the scrapped 'Workers of the world. Eat Krackle' advertising campaign. So, do with this information what you wish, but keep your eyes and ears pealed, for Halloween is just around the corner.             "
3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 ...Our Program already in Progress:  Hello friends. I guess this first of all posts should begin with a little about myself. That's easy, the name's Travis. I'm 21, on the brink of 22-dom. I currently reside in the DC area. I've been here for about a month and I think I'll keep it. I'm an engineer and I'm gay. I stand by my opinion that gay engineers make cool engineers, whereas straight engineers make dorks...  That's not meant as a dig to any of you. Making fun of others just makes you feel better about yourself. No seriously... There are some kickass not-completely-devoid-of-social-skills engineers out there. Of the 14 on the east coast... I'm friends with 12.   A little background, you ask? Okay... Born and bred in suburban Connecticut. Had your normal childhood. Shitty at times, lovely the next day. I just had that one thing that made me a little different than all my friends. That one thing that I couldn't talk about for most of my life. But then don't we all. I don't mean to depict my sexual orientation as a sob story by any means. We all have our trials and tribulations and are stronger/wiser for having experienced them. And don't get me wrong I had a loving supportive family, conservative and religious at the crux, but subsequently (and possibly hypocritically) supportive during my coming out.  I had two older siblings, the kind you love to hate, and hate to love, again typical. They are two of the most amazing people I know. I looked up to them so much in my life my neck is still sore. At times I couldn't stand them, at times they'd make me cry, but I wouldn't have it any other way.  And now on to my final family member, my secondary caretaker... TV. I have this long standing opinion that nearly everything I know I've learned from TV. If you yield the power of that beautiful glowing box for good, the world is your oyster. Well maybe not that much, but as Martha would say 'It's a good thing.' Early in my childhood I discovered (no not men, that came a little later), movies. Thank god I was born when I was, 'cause the VCR shaped my life. Look upon this as you wish, but I believe it was genuinely good  Whenever you talk to a gay person, well at least most of the time. They always say, 'I always new I was different.' Which is our way of saying even before I got erections from MTV's 'The Grind,' (Go Eric) I knew somethin' was up. So in order to escape those alienation feelings I entered what I have since dubbed 'my celluloid closet.' Was it healthy, maybe not, but it got me through a lot of years when I wasn't ready to face myself. People often wonder why they didn't know. To a certain extent so do I, but I sure as hell didn't want them to figure it out. Is this why there are so many homosexuals in Hollywood? Is it because we all grow up as actors? Well I played the part well. I didn't go as far as to submerse myself in athletics, but I have gotten to the point where I can't tell if things I like are mine, or my cover's. I'm like Charlie Baltimore in 'The Long Kiss Goodnight,' or am I Samantha Caine? Take music for one: Do I really like Metallica, or was that just my psyche trying to compensate my seemingly feminine 'condition' with more masculine characteristics? Well I am 1 year+ out of that closet, and this sort of self discovery is going to continue for a little while.   Maybe that's why I'm starting this... but I highly doubt it 'cause I predict that the majority of the posts will be of a random nature as an outlet for the funny that courses through my veins.

3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 I had a lot of fun this weekend.  On saturday a coupla friends and I went to a DC101 (radio station in our nation's capitol) holloween party.  It was pretty cool, we didn't dress up or anything, but we all wore leather pants... I mean there's really no occasion otherwhen in the year to encase yourself in treated and dyed animal flesh, so you gotta take the opportunity when it arises.  Anywho, It was fun and I got trashed... naturally.  But I was Ferris Beulering everything.  I few hours into the party we were on the dance floor and some guy was carrying chicken to the VIP room.  I made and 'ooh, ooh' noise and pointed... so he stopped came back and let me swipe a piece.  I don't know who that kind soul was, but I was never the same after that moment...    ...And then I thought things couldn't get better, I had just scored some comp-fowl and there was a disco band that was really kickin'.  I was wrong.  I go up to the band to try to request some Jackson five (a Jender and T-$$ staple when dancing), but struck out 'No Motown he says... Try the DJ he says.'  Well it was a big neg from the DJ too (actually I think he said yes, but I didn't hear it, 'cause... well you'll see why).  So I'm  on my way back to my friends when I see Giligan trying to get into the VIP room, and the bouncer stopped him.  Meanwhile I look all official coming from the DJ booth and everything, so I call out 'No, that's Giligan let him in.'  In the wake of my thrall the bouncer bends to my desire... then I just walk in.  Now I've already had 5 beers at this point and there was free shit in VIP, bad combo for the T-ster.  So I try to contact Jender via cellular technology, but nothin', thankfully they came in a little later when the bouncer stepped away for a pee break.  Meanwhile I'm sitting around with all these radio people, and I see Giligan and he's like 'Dude, you got me in.'  and I'm like 'Go me!'      So I end up talking to Diane from the Elliot in the Morning Show for like and hour.  It must really suck to be them, 'cause they live hours of their lives in the public eye, and it must be taxing how everyone they talk to thinks they're like bestest frinds 'cause they ease the morning commute.  But back to me I down like 5 more beers, and Travis is kicked.  So I pile up a plate of wings and we head for the Metro.    Now this is where I forget everything.  I remember vaguely getting on the metro and making a fool of myself while I was on it.  I was told that I was telling everyone to get off ''cause Swank was too sexy.' Thank god for Nordstroms 'cause I strapped the handles of a shopping bag on my ears like a feed bag and yakked all the way from Vienna back to Jender's.    All in all I had a blast, until sunday morning.  but all y'all know what that's like. Late...             "

'Cause I can make anything sound bad like if I get - 'You're going to come into a large sum of money,' I'll translate it to 'You're gonna die alone you ugly bitch, and the only thing that will have sex with you will be cold hard cash.'

We watched old monster movies and carved pumpkins.  I forgot my pumpkin, but I'll get it tomorrow.  Anyway it doesn't matter it looked like Marv Albert.  Jender's was kick-ass though.  Solely because of the mouth.  which was my Idea. (just saving face 'cause even the cute dimple on mine couldn't salvage the gourd as a whole)    Anyway the next day She and I, and a new friend Swank went to Six Flags in MD.  It was a lot of fun, and a beautiful day.  But I wanted to hurl the whole time.  We were in line for the Batwing, right, and Swank was all 'I don't wanna go on.. hear the people screaming?'  So Jender was like 'They're just happy,' and I was all 'They're screaming for Charo.'  It was really funny, at least to me in my diminshed brain cells state.  So after dropping a Jackson at random games around the park I won back to back roll-a-balls and acquired a stuffed Aligator named Charo (coincidence... there are two things I don't believe in... Coincidence and Gay Republicans).  Come to find out Charo is actually a transvestite and his real name is Ken Adams, how's that for twilight zoniness?

I was having a personal problem last week... I couldn't find my deoderant.  I knew it was around somewhere 'cause it's not like you pick it up and walk around the house with it.  Ya know you use it and put it right back.  It's like misplacing milk... It just doesn't happen.  Well I was in my room yesterday and I saw my Life insurance policy on my table, and it hit me... Maybe it's under there.  Sure enough... Boy did I feel dumb... I was like 'Salt and Pepper my face 'cause it makes the egg taste better.'  But the funny thing is since I've received my Policy I've been more at ease that my loved ones will be taken care of if I... ya know... kick it.

3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 Why can't the desire to fuck be transitive?    I was pondering this on the shitter...  oops crapper... today.  Since there is a mirror right there.  I was looking at my new highlights... and I quite like them now that I've showered.  I'm mean one of the benefits of being gay is that I'm my own demographic.  I was like:    If I came up to me and hit on me I would be receptive.  Therefore it goes to reason that I would hit on me.  (I think I achieved fourth person there)    So lets take a for instance... Mike Greybeal (grrrr...  he's this dude that was on undressed for a few episodes, a major beauty on the hot scale)...  So on a given day, lets say Tuesday, I'd have sex with him.  Now if we couple this with the above, 'I'd have sex with me,' then geometry would dictate that he would have sex with me.    But then I got to thinking; you throw in a girl who has bisexual tendencies who is attracted to me, then I'd have to want to have sex with her... and this just throws a wrench in the whole rigmoroll.  So I have tucked the 'Transitive-Fuck' theory in a drawer with my other thwarted thoughts like: 'I deserve to be wealthier than the crocodile hunter,' and 'with all the Grape-Nuts in the world why is there still hunger?'    Well bye now.    PS.  I had this weird dream last night, and I'm pissed that I can't remember the Haiku that was in it... 'cause it made me laugh... well as much as a sleeping person can laugh.             "

FOX showed the ever-so-enthralling 'Who Wants to be a Princess?' It sucked...  and I was stupider for having watched it.  Well, there was one good part.  When they were modeling and it showed their likes and dislikes... Everyone's dislikes were like: 'Mean People,' 'Ignorant People,' 'Dishonesty,' but this one girl's was 'Moth Ball's and Hyper Dogs.'  I wanted to jump in the screen give her a big smooch and hand her the crown.  I mean how real...  I laughed for like 10 minutes solid.  But then I saw the prince, and I was like 'I'm glad she didn't win... what a troll.  I'd rather hop on Benjamin the results giver,' or as his resume would say 'Special Liaison to the Judges.'

So it was the finals of the national groundhog races and the favorite, ButterBuns, was up against the underdog, Nicky.  I wanted Nicky to win 'cause I had a nickel on him.    There was a little confusion 'cause Nicky wasn't high in the polling system, but he had won all his matches, so a challenge was extended on ButterBuns' behalf, but the Judges ruled in favor of Nicky.  BB was dressed in a Bumble bee outfit complete with fuzzy antenae.  An obvious crowd favorite to Nicky's black jersey.    And they're off!!!  ButterBuns took an early lead at 50m, but Nickey pulled it out in the last leg.  So I took my 5 g's to the victory party and got completely smashed.  It was a good day.  Even Punxatawney Phil came out, but stardom has really gotten to him, and he's been hitting the H a little too hard.  So he just sits around and waits for February when the spotlight is on him.  That prognasticating fuck, he's nothing more than a glorified coin toss.    Calc-u-lator             "
3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 Well I'm back at work.  Fuck all you who aren't.  I hope everyone had a nice holiday weekend.  I did.    Holiday traditions are weird.  I don't know why.  Okay I come from a Catholic family, but I'm an Atheist, so I constantly have a battle of what i should do.  What is the least disrepectful to my family, and what is the least disrespectful to their religion.  I simply choose to abstain from most of it.  I go to Christmas eve mass, but I don't participate.  I basically just sit there and look around, usually checking out boys, but then I check myself 'cause that's not the place.  But then there's grace, and all the family talking about how nice the service was.  And I'm like 'ehh.'  It's painful.    But then we go to my cousins to eat.  This is my dad's side of the family, very Slovak.  It's fun, but 'Holy Supper' as it is called, is very shiny.  I don't know if you know about Slovakian food, but it's all cabbage, potato, and lots and lots of butter.  Every year we sit down to a meal of saurkraut soup, boiled potatos, perogies, cabbage and noodles, kielbasa and kraut, etc.  Lard basically.  But I love it.  Then Christmas day is when we get turkey and other American things.    I scored some pretty good gifts this year.  Got the Sapranos 1 & 2, sheets (only 440, but ehh, I can't stay mad at my mom), Dr. Zhivago, Rogue Leader, two pairs of shoes, a Gamecube case, and some other stuff.  Damn I'm spoiled.  I'm like 22 and I still get lots of gifts.    I talked to my Grandfather this weekend on the phone for like 20 minutes.  It was strange, I've never talked to him for more than 5 minutes, and even then it would be about computers.  But this time it was about everything.  Apparently he has a girlfriend.  Well that just pulls my cork (I don't know what it means, but my Nanny said it this weekend, she so funny, she's 85 and quite a firecracker), I can't believe my 78 year old grandfather can get a girlfriend, and I am boyless.  But anyway, he asked me if I had a girlfriend, and I'm like 'ehhh, no.'  It's not like I think that he wouldn't approve or anything, I just don't feel it's necessary to tell all the old people until ya know I'm in a relationship that last longer than a week... erm... end.  I was psyched though, I got off the phone with him and I turn to my brother and I'm like 'I'm his favorite.'    My brother was really funny this weekend though, we got drunk yesterday and apparently he wants to be on Saturday Night Live.  I'm not sure if he's up for it, but I think we come from some pretty funny stock.  We talked until like 3 in the morning.  It was fun.  I get to meet his girlfriend when I'm in NYC for New Years.  I'm psyched.    Then before I hopped in my car to return to the Nation's Cap we went over to my mom's side, very Italian.  But the ass grabbin' didn't last that long I had to get on the road.    God I'm boring today.  Recounting my holiday isn't much fun for y'ins.    In the words of my baby cousin: 'I don't wike tickows'             "

So we sponsored this little girl, her name was Pinky.  (Which coincidentally became the name of my first goldfish, making my porn name Pinky Washington.  With a name like that I'd have to do porn as a tranni)  So for the longest time, which was probably like a few months I thought that Pinky was actually my sister, and I couldn't figure out why she didn't live with us.  I was such a 'ron of a tyke.    Also for a while I thought that the term 'rents' (as in 'I'm living with the rents') was in reference to the fact that you should be paying rent, not a shortened version of parents.  For a smart guy I'm so dumb.    Fish and Chips and Chips and Fish Fish and Chips and Chips and Fish Fish and Chips and Chips and Fish Oh what a delicious dish!    (I hate fish and chips, but that just poped into my head, for no reason.  I'm drinking coffee for peeper's sake)             "

I gotta find a new thing to eat, 'cause sushi (although quite satisfying without the clogged pore/enlarging thighs feeling of a BigMac) is so last year.  It's somewhere between '5 minutes ago' and 'out' on the Shaw Report.  I mean as far as food fads go it's pretty good, but when are we gonna have another bad-for-you food fad.  Why can't  Ben and Jerry's  come back into style?..  Well without all the hemp accessories and plaid.    In addition, I believe I may have ended my boycott of artificial sweeteners.  I'm drinking a Diet Coke (oops, I corrected it, but that 'coke' was originally a bad word... or rather a great word).  Finally I feel like I am actually comming into my own as a gay man.  I mean who among the human race enjoys men, and drinks exclusively straight up soda.  I mean only heteros like sugar in the can.  We prefer (a)sper(ta)m(e).    Anyway, I'm just a big goof today.

It's a day we invented 'cause my sister finished her last final (3rd year law school) last night.  Her name is Traci, but I call her Stacey sometimes...  'cause I have a bad memory.    I had my first Krispy Kreme doughnut today.  I can't believe I've been a KK virgin for 22 years.  It was awesome.  There's about a dozen more in the break room, but I don't want anymore, I think I'd be ruined for life, not to mention this afternoon.  Last night I forgot to eat, so I'm betting some time around 11 It'll be go time, and the more greasy the food is I eat the less pleasant the experience will be.    Tomorrow I head back to CT, the land of commuters and bad beaches.  But hell I love it.  I can't wait to see all my friends.  Then it's back here on tuesday, and back to manhattan on friday only to come back here the following tuesday.  I'm just a ping pong ball and the Delaware Memorial Bridge is my net.

3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 Okay so I got to thinking you all know about my thoughts and my life, but what about my subconscious?  So I decided to start this new segment call... (cue dramatic music)    NAME THAT CHILDHOOD TRAUMA!!!    It's about dreams, and if you have theories on what my dreams are about let me know.    Okay so last night I had this dream that I was at a Naval Academy graduation, not as a graduate but as a spectator.  So I come up into the stands but I'm on the wrong side.  (sidebar: I also had an ability to jump really high)  So I whip out 2 umbrellas, one of which is inside out and pointed down, and I jump really high and drift slowly towards the other side of the bleachers.  It took about 4 jumps and every time I landed on a soon-to-be alumn I realize that they're all people I knew from high school.  So I finally get to where my family is and the Admiral who is giving the key note speech said 'GOOD JOB!!!'  Then the whole stadium erupted in applause.    I have no idea either...             "
3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 I have no idea what is up with people today.  Elliott in the Morning (DC101's morning show) was a veritable conucopia of nut jobs.  For 30 minutes they talked to a 60+ year old Barber in Rockville, MD who likes to wear a bra and fake 44 D's while he cuts people's hair.  So this fella, Luis, dressed up and became Luise, I felt bad after a while 'cause they were going a little far, but it was funny.  But they were also pressing him about being gay even though he said he wasn't.  I mean there is a difference between cross-dressing and homosexuality.  I thought that we all figured this out with J. Edgar.    And then afterwards some people in traffic called in and said that two girls with a camera were hanging out on the side of the road with a sign saying 'Show us your twins.'  People are so nutty some times.  I don't know if people actually obeyed their wishes, but I'm sure it was a site to see.  I wish that would happen when I'm in traffic, 'cause I get so damn bored.    Anyway, I think I'm now in love with Nick Hexum from 311(drool).  I'm gonna go fantasize now.    Oh yeah, and if anyone has a life that they can spare I'll give ya 50 bucks for it.             "
3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 So for lunch today a coworker and I went to the mall 'cause he had to get a present for his little cousin.  While there and walking down the aisle I hear a punk kid (when did I turn 65?) say 'Hey there goes the faggots.'  I look around to see who he was referring to, come to find out he was talking about some uniformed military personnel.  I was a little peeved, I mean c'mon.  Especially with all the crap going on, show some respect.  Not to mention his use of the f word, I mean when my friends say it to me it's kinda funny, 'cause I know that they love me, but saying it in public.  Okay that's enough moral outrage, that's not really what this site is supposed to be about.    Well anyway I bought the new 311 CD, 'cause I like 2 songs.  I have got to stop doing this.  I mean, I just got the System of a Down CD too, and I only knew 1 song.  But whatever, I think the 311 dude has a really sexy voice, so I'll probably enjoy the rest of it.    I think I mainly pick my music 'cause I like the guy's voice.  I mean I rarely listen to female vocalists, sometimes, but not nearly as much as the fellas.  Is that wrong?  I ask you.  I mean it doesn't have to be rip your clothes off sexy, even just cute sexy.  Here's my CD changer line up right now:    1: Mix with Dave Matthews, Disturbed, etc (soon to be 311) 2: Pete Yorn 3: Gorillaz 4: Incubus 5: Linkin Park 5: System of a Down    I mean and look at my past favs:    Metallica Travis Coldplay REM Ben Folds Alice in Chains Soundgarden Tool The Beatles Limp Bizkit Michael Jackson Supergrass Billy Joel Finger 11 ...

3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 So Atlantic city this weekend was a lot of fun.  Although I did only spend (or waste) what I had allotted I still come away more affluently challenged than last week.  But I think it was worth it.  On the trip up Jender was a worthy companion:    (While driving through Baltimore) Jender: Look at the cruise ship! Me: Uhhh, honey... That's the Coast Guard    With conversations like that the trip was quite entertaining.  It was a little chilly though walking from the hotel to and from Ceasar's, my balls were brick-ass frozen.  And along the Miss America walk of (f/sh)ame watching Jender do the 'elbow-elbow-wrist-wrist-wrist' wave was a hoot.    But back at the Sheraton bar we had a blast.  Broke and busted we whipped out the plastic and charged up a tab.  The two bartenders were hot (one with and one without a peeper) and a lot of fun.  And the live entertainment was at a perfect volume, loud enough for you to be able to sing without bothering anyone, but quiet enough for you to converse.  Throughout the night Jender was requesting (aka screaming) 'Mr. Big, Mr. Big!!!'  But it never came, but there was some good Journey, Billy Joel, etc.  I was all 'ugn scht, ugn ahh,' during Allentown.  14 drinks and a hot-as-hell order of chicken fingers later we ended the night.    The drive back was eventful.  I caught holy hell when, BOTH of us I might add, missed the exit for the turnpike, so we ended up in Philly.    J: Should we turn around T: Um I think we can pick up 95 in Philly J: YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE T: Hey we both missed the exit and we both drove here, but I know 95 goes to Philly so I'm pretty sure we can pick it up J: PRETTY SURE, WE'RE LOST YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE WE ARE T: YES I DO, THERE'S PHILLY, if we don't hit 95, we can turn around J: JUST 'CAUSE WE CAN SEE PHILLY DOESN'T MEAN YOU KNOW WHERE WE ARE T: CALM DOWN J: DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN, WE'RE LOST (Lo and Behold we come up on 95) T: See we're okay. J: (laughing) We fight like a married couple.    So we made it home actually faster than if we didn't go through PA, 'cause we didn't hit any stop lights.  All in all, a successful road trip.             "
3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 Dear readers I brought my car in for service today.  I think the guy was a little peeved that it's like 7k past due.  He got the 'mommy/daddy bought that for you ya brat and you can't take care of it' look on his face.  Meanwhile I'm scrimping and saving to make the payments (shuttup).  And I'm like 'Um...and...um...I got a dent...and if you get a chance could you check it out...um...'  I'm so not forcefull.  I have no power.  I can't remember the last time I had any power.  And I'm not talking sexual power, or conversational power, 'cause I've had that, I'm talking social status power.  Oooh, ooh, I remember:    Picture it, Connecticut 1989.  My brother's team just won the Little League World Series in Williamsport, PA and I'm feeling a little unattended, if you will.  So as I enter the fifth grade I obtain the most coveted position an elementary school student could have:  Bus Patrol.  [CUE EERIE MUSIC]  Not only did I get the fashonably blinding orange belt/Miss america sash, but I got a badge.  Okay I don't know about your neck of the woods but in our precinct the badges worked like this:    No Trim: Patrol  Red trim: Sergeant (Walkers) Green trim: Lieutenant (1 per bus) Blue trim: Captain (2 per school)    So me and one of my friends (who was my grade nemesis to my parents, but I could give too shits about grades, I haven't come too far) were the Captains.  Captain Horton and I ran the monthly meetings.  In addition I had carte blanche for 20 minutes a day 'cause I was the first bus stop in the morning and the last in the afternoon.  And at any time I could boss people around or even...  SIT IN THE BACK!!!  It was like the holy grail to single digit peeps.  I loved it in the rear (I definitly haven't come too far).  But as a fair an impartial emperor, I joke I mean captain, I joke I mean RULER! I invoked the Magna Carta of Bus #13 agreements (okay Lietunant Cohen helped draft it, I couldn't spell well, damn I'm like the same person as I was 12 years ago, just with better fashion sense, and without the two inch lenses warping my NOSE FOREVER... I'm bitter).  This agreement was an organized schedule that placed the 6 patrols in pairs (A, B, and C) on a weekly rotating schedule for sitting in the front, middle and REAR.  This way if any of the yungsters had problems a patrol would be within 4 seats and also a patrol would always be in the emergency exit row.    So as my brother was getting free trips to Yankee Stadium, Shea and Fenway I was taking my anger out on 4th graders.  Especially that kid, something Weiner, he was such a cock.    Oh to weild that sort of power again...             "

Smoke, starve, etc.  anything to get rid of it.  (I'm actually kidding here I don't actually think it's true)  So water only for my uninvited cohibitant.    Last night I had a dream that I was at a concert and my baby got hit.  Sgt. Hughes was all banged up, I was quite distraught.  I never actually got to see the Moody Blues.  That's a recurring dream for me.  Going to a concert and not making it out of the parking lot for one reason or another, but it's usually 'cause of drinking, drugs (which I don't even use), or other debauched activities.  I wonder why.  At least it's not teeth falling out, I hear that's about anxiety, and it only makes me more anxious.    So I bought Pikmin for GameCube yesterday.  It's actually a lot of fun, but kinda involved.  Those little guys are kinda cute, and the little space man is awww-dorable.  We'll see how it pans out.    I hope AC goes well.  I think I'm gonna buy a powerball ticket too.  I read that it was my golden month, so I'm hoping I can score big.  Actually e read it to me.  It was in some summer issue in Jane.  But it did say I'd get a job in August (which I did), and get some lovin' in October (well my skank activity was in November, but I'm a late Libra), so maybe.  Or maybe it means that I'm finally gonna buy ABBA Gold (that's what Jender and I are gonna listen to on the way to Sodom... I mean Atlantic City).  Well either way I'm happy.    Tonight is the finale of The Amazing Race, and it has been a trip, let me tell you.  It seems like such a cool show to be on, even if you lose you at least get to go to some cool places and do some cool shit.  I don't know who I want to win though.  Team Guido is way back (thank god, they give homos a bad name).  So it's between Rob and Brennan (the hot lawyers), and Frank and Margarita (the separated couple),  I think my vote is for F&M 'cause it looks like they may be able to patch things up and there's a kid involed in that relationship.  I just hope those crazy kids can work it out.  Well it would help if Frank would stop being abusive, which, to his merit, he seems to have turned it around lately.  But now that Kevin and Drew are outta it I don't care too much, those guys were a laugh riot.    I'm hungry, or rather my flatworm cohort is, but I think I'm gonna stall him until 1.

3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 So I was peeing in the urinal yesterday when it hit me.  I prefer street shopping in the winter.    Why you ask?  Well here's my reason.  In the winter when you street shop the natural light is dim, making for highly reflective glare free store windows.  And we all know about the expansive and contractatory (I made up that word right?) properties of glass.  So when the inside tempurature is warmer than the outside temperature it makes the inner plane of the window slightly larger than the outer plane, thus creating a slightly concave surface.  This makes you look thin and beautiful.  Generally panes of glass are taller than they are wide, if you are walking past a store where the pane is wider than it is tall, look away, it will only make you look short.  Conversely in the summer you look fat.  This is a variation on the hall of mirrors attraction at amusement parks.  Be forwarned that this is not always the case as some new windows are installed more snug than others to allow for settling and foundation frost heaving.    I know what you're thinking, 'Damn that was a long pee.'  Well your right, I think I drink too much coffee in the morning.    So then I shook it twice ('cause any more and I'd be playing with it), and went back to my desk.              "
3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 So I think I'm getting stupid...  and it sucks.    Some time last week I was on the phone in the back yard smoking, when I finished my cigarette I proceeded to come inside.  The sliding door was open so I just walked in...walked in is right...right into the screen door.  My brother-in-law still busts on me for that.    A few days later I take another way home right, to avoid traffic.  So I'm driving down the street (in the opposite direction from what I usually do) and I notice that there are a lot of cars parked.  So I pick a spot between two unfamiliar cars thinking maybe someone's having a party.  Parallel park effortlessly, it was great.  Then I get out and approach the door, finally it dawns on me.  'Where's the huge mound and trees?'  I was about a block short of my house, so I stood there for a few minutes trying to decide weather to move the car or just walk, finally I decide to move it.  So I walk up to the door, put the key in, and guess what... it doesn't turn.  I got all embarrassed and pissed, then I realized that I just didn't put it in far enough, so I went inside defeated.    On a completely different topic I was watching Trading Spaces with my sister this weekend and Vern was painting a room red, the walls and the ceiling, and my sister and I got to talking:    Traci: Vern likes Red. Me: Vern really likes Red. Traci: Red is Vern's favorite color. Me: Vern loves Red. Traci: Vern really loves Red. Me: Vern's gonna marry Red.    I really think some good points were brought up in that conversation so I thought I'd share.               "

Well first off when I was in Pitt like ages ago (if you recall this was the skank day) I went out to eat with a coupla friends.  And strangly enough we all got the same fortune:    Prejudice is the child of ignorance.    At least it wasn't bad, and kinda informative.  Also the Pitt delt me this one:    What makes an Apple fall to the ground?    Well I'm no physisist, but this doesn't strike me as the brain buster it's portrayed as.  Finally this weekend I got what experts believe is the best fortune ever:    You are almost there.    Shortly after reading this I DID in fact arrive at a destination.

I'm sitting in work trying to figure out something to do and I get some coffee.  It tastes really bitter and strong.  So I'm like 'I wish someone could combine the manly bean flavor of coffee with the smooth leaf flavor of tea.'  Well someone can.  So I steeped tea in already strong coffee.  The bitterness was removed.  I can't decide whether to call it Coffeete or Teaffee.    I'm telling ya this thing is like the closest thing you can get to opium (yeah whatever like I'd know).  I'm so high on caffiene right now.  SHUT UP LITTLE LEPRECHAUN MAN I'M TRYING TO TYPE!    Anywho, I emplore you all to give it a whirl, but only if you don't have to drive for at least 6 hours.

I almost puked a little while ago, and my heart is beating at an unprecedented rate.  I need a valium.  These DTs suck.  I'm through with Teafee, I'm glad I got that monkey off my back... On an unrelated note I'm looking forward to a weekend of drinking and debauchery.             "

I'd call it 'The Daily Grind.'  Get it?  I think it's cute in a quarky way.  Once I get that inexhaustible source of income I'm set.  Then you all can take a break from your daily grind and stop in for some coffee.  I wouldn't be there though 'cause I'd have so much money I wouldn't be friends with the likes of you anymore.    Well, here's to wishing I'll never see your ugly mug anymore!!    Just kiddind... Ta-ta             "

God it's like I'm having hot flashes...  Oh shit... maybe it's menopause.  Great like I need to have another reason I'm not going to have kids.  Like keeping my cell phone in my pocket near my buddies and smoking aren't enough reason.  Not to mention the fact that all ovum are banned from sexual encounters involving me.    Well back to my desk.  It's cooler in that corner of the room anyway.             "

But anyway, I haven't put anything up here in like a week.  I can't think of anytrhing funny to write about.    Well yesterday bit...(commence bitch) I had a swift 2 hour commute in the morning - BLAHHHH!!  Some 18 wheeler bottomed out...  It was like someone took the two ends of it and snapped it, like a popoid (remember popoids, I used to make popoid cars and pilot them with my weebles).  So that was a pain in my tushie.  Then my evening drive to Tysons to meet Jender for a lovely dinner (Thai) was trafficky too.  And there was an accident on the way home from the mall.  I completed the beltway in one day yesterday and it only took 4 hours in the car ARGHH!  But I think it was worth it, 'cause when we were in the Gap I was like 'I like those jeans,' and Jender was like 'I like that Mannequin's ass,' I about lost it.    Well I think that's it.  Later.             "
3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 So I'm thinking (this just means passing thought, not definite) of getting a nose job.  I snore okay.  I would like to fix that... well that and I hate my nose like huge-time.  I surfed for a bit to see how much it'd set me back, and they only run like 3 grand.  Maybe next year.  I just don't know how to explain the time off, or the different nose to people at work.  Am I incredibly vain?  Well of course.  Aren't we all. What do you think?  I mean I don't really think it'd be a waste of money, say I'm gonna live for like at least 40 more years, that's just pennies a day. (wait lets calculate: 3000/(40*365.25) = $0.21) It's totally fiscally responsible.             "
3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 Pull up a chair and mainline the ginko it's time for last night's dream:    I'm at home with my sis and her husband about to watch a movie, so we dim the lights.  All of a sudden the wind seems to pick up and a tree flys by the window.  I'm like 'Look that tree has many trunks.' And then the wind began to switch the house to pitch and suddenly the hinges started to unhitch just then the witch, to satisfy an itch went flying on her broomstick thumbing for a hitch.  So we high tailed it outta there and headed for the beach, which as we all know is the only safe place during times of hurricane.  I dimly recall how I saw in a movie that if there's a hurricane and you're on the beach head south since hurricane's travel north.  But since we were on the west coast it was reversed.  To get a better view of the situation my mother (um, hi mom, when did you get here) suggested that we ride the ferris wheel.  From that vantage point we could see what remained of our house and the fact that the winds had died down.  So we two step it back to the neighborhood hoping there's something left...    On the way we run into my sister's friend, she and her husband were okay, but it seemed that the 'cane had swallowed up their dog Josh (which is sad 'cause I love Josh, he's like the only dog I've really liked.  I told Jender that I liked dogs with people names and she's like 'what like Margerie,' and I'm like 'I said dogs not bridge partners.').  So I'm totally bumbed out by this Josh is gone thing, so I go out with some high school friends...    We running-man up to the top of a really tall building.  I'm like 'Hey my house got blown up by that 'cane.'  And they're like 'really.'  I was pissed that they didn't care more.  Then my friend Steph is like 'look at this ad I saw in the Catholic Journal.'  And it's a guy with his hand on a balcony pulling himself up.  It's like a anti-suicide ad, and the caption said 'When you're holdin' Your golden.'  It was like even when you've jumped it's not too late to grab onto anything.  It went on to say that it's okay, all you need is a good grasp, because then the hair products you use will get cought by the wind and carry the  majority  of your weight to saftey.  Unfortunately our hair product booted us over the edge.  As we fell we grabbed onto the 1st floor balcony and were saved.  I was still upset from the apathy of my friends so I was like 'I'm going for ice cream'...    I get the the ice cream counter and the cute attendant slips my a dark chocolate scoop for free.  Then this girl Amber sits next to me and I proceed to hit on her and successfully pick her up, which is funny 'cause I don't like chocolate ice cream.  She didn't get what she wanted either so she complained.  Wackyness ensued and we get chased outta there by this b(i/u)tch woman.  We end up switching ice creams, it was sickenly sweet a spectacle.  How hetero...    We go to see a movie and back to her place for some drinks, meanwhile I'm like 'what time is it.' She's like '6 why?' I'm like 'I was supposed to catch some gay porn on VH1 at 11, but I guess I missed it.'  After a few drinks she start kickin' it into high gear, and I'm feeling all experimental and I'm like as long as my pants stay on I'm not straight.  (I don't get the reasoning either)  So I was all about pleasing her and did some things I will not go into, not because they're graphic, but because I don't want to remember that. ever.  Regaurdless I was all about pleasing her, which is weird 'cause I'm selfish in bed (hehe).  So she was happy...    The next day I go to work as a waiter in this upscale bar.  As I'm waiting the tables I see Amber and she calls me over to where her friends are.  It turns out that she's kinda a professional woman.  Not like a ho, but rather a girl who hangs out with hot guys who have money so they don't have to buy anything.  She turns to her friend, Shoe, another golddigger (what the hell kinda name is that), and is like 'This guy knows how to treat a woman,' Shoe: 'He's that good.' Amber: 'Def.'  So Amber goes to town on Shoe while Shoe is licking my eyelid, which I don't know if it feels this good in real life ('lick my eyelid' is not really in my pillow-talk repertoire) but I was likin' it big time...    I bolted up from unconsciousness with pink eye and thinking 'am I a lesbian?'             "
3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 I spent so much money yesterday, and more to come this weekend.  I bought a new down comforter, pillow, and mattress.  I can't wait to hook it all up, with my 440 ct sheets, I'm never gonna wanna get outta bed.  WOOHOO!!  I'm gonna get the mattress delive-d on tuesday.  Hopefull by then I'll already have the bed frame and desk I want.  I'm so 'cited.    Do you ever listen to music and it brings you back to a time forgotten?  Recently XTC's  Dear God  has been taking me back to last spring.  I guess it's in part due to the fact that it's fucking hot out in the District.  But it just reminds me of when I was moving out of Pittsburgh and I was cooking everything in my freezer.  I'd make like 5 meals a day.  I think one day I made burgers, perogies, two kinds of rice, two kinds of pasta, and pork chops.  That was fun.  I was like pouring olive oil on everything.  I guess that's the guinea in me (is that how you spell that?  or is that like a country?  I'm not sure, where do you even look up the spelling of racial epithets?).   Offensive Slang  . Used as a disparaging term for a person of Italian birth or descent.  IT IS!  Go me... get funky... it's my birthday!               "

Now don't quote me on this 'cause I have other theories too, but I saw what I think was a Harrier Jet.  I was driving along and I'm like 'that jet is moving really slow.'  A little later I notice that it prety much wasn't moving at all.  I mean I could be wrong, 'cause I was in traffic and delusional.  It was either that or a jet shaped baloon, or maybe a jet on a stick.  But then again it was green wheras in  True Lies  it was grey.  Do you think the Harrier Jet comes in more than one color?  I'd like to get one in sky blue, 'cause I'd be virtually invisible to people on the ground.  Oh the possibilities...             "

Just kidding, I won't know the break down until tonight, I could only check out the total score.  'Paging Mr. Bigfatstupidloser?, Mr. Bigfatstupidloser your mother wants you home by 9.'    Other than that I have nothing to say today.  Ehh.  Fuck it.  I'm having a blah blah day.  But tonight is new  Buffy , so happy Trav.    I love you all, but d'ya know what I love more?  No, not anonymous sex.  Nicotine.  Off to smoke.  Late    PS.  I think someone got here by searching for 'thalky' on google, I hope they weren't looking for my bro or sis.  I should've picked something less confusing.  I'm stupid.  But in college people would call me 'Alky Thalky,' 'cause I'd drink like a horse, and it just kinda stuck (well in my head at least, nobody really calls me that anymore)             "

GO HERE   if you wanna have fun too. Or just waste some time.    I think I want to apply again (want to again, not apply again).  I've always just put it off.  But I think it'd be fun.  I'm such a waste of space sometimes.  I just want adventure.  Maybe I should just get lost in Jersey again.    Whatever, happy monday, and good luck with your teams (I know none of you will actually do it, and I say fuck you... I'll be having fun, and what will you be doing?  HUH?

I think I'm gonna check out today at 3 'cause it's happy weekend, and the earlier I leave the less traffic I hit.  I'm in a good mood, but I just got to work, so I wonder how long that will last.    My sister was so moody and funny last night.  We were sitting and she was whining about chocolate, so she wanted me to get her a cookie dough Slim Fast bar (Okay, is the concept lost on me, or are those things supposed to be for lunch, not a post dinner snack), so I kept going to the kitchen and firing back the wrong ones.  Apparently we have like 4 types of bars in the house.  But she couldn't catch (maybe it's genetic, oh wait my brother can catch, and she's a girl and I'm a fag), so it hit her in the eye.  For the rest of the night she's like 'Am I swollen,' so I got her mind off it by saying, 'No, but one of your eyebrows is like an inch lower than the other.  You need to wax.'  I know it's not the nicest thing to say, but she was annoying.  Then a game of cards solved it all.             "

Seriously I was like an inch from being sent to that island ( see last entry ).  So I whipped out the scissors and started cutting.  Don't get me wrong I wasn't like sculpting, I mean I'm no Edward Scissorhands.  I just thinned out the burns and cut a little off the back so it wouldn't curl under, it usually buys me a week and a half.  But now I have a bald line through my right sideburn.  I'm all sheepish.  But if anyone brings it up I have the perfect homo cover:      Person : What happened to your hair.  Me:      I know.  See I was trying to save some money for this new Kenneth Cole jacket so I went to Supercuts.  Big mistake.  I will never do that again.  There gonna hear from my lawyer in 2 to 4 days.  I should have known.  From now on only Dominique touches my hair.  She's a miracal worker with my roots.  I'm sorry I have to jam.  I'm off to Saks to pick up a new hat to cover this mop.

I guess it's 'cause it's the only time during the day I drink cold beverage.  God that was neither informative nor entertaining.  So I was looking through EW this week, and I came across an ad for  40 Days and 40 Nights  and I have to admit I'm intrigued.  I mean the movie is gonna suck, big time, but I'll probably see it.  I mean Josh Hartnett forgoing all forms of sex for lent.  It must be fraught with sexual tension and inuendo.  Fun, Fun.  I on the other hand have never, nor will I ever, give up anything for lent.  I don't get it.  Even for religious folk.  How is that 'proving yourself to god' or some such shit.  I would always mock give up stuff like: Homework, or taxes, or better yet women.    Did I tell you guys...  wait I'll do a little search.  I guess not.  I work with a Tom Jones.  I think that's so funny.  I told someone this the other day and they started to laugh, so I'm like 'It's not unusual.'  In addition to that I work with a Brian Wilson, and it's fun fun fun, just like lying in bed.  To top it all off I think I heard a page once for a Dennis Hopper, but I'm looking into that.  Sorry for the pittiful puns.    Come on 5 o'clock... Come to daddy!             "

I just gotta give the complex a call and make sure I can get a parking space.  Woo-Hoo!!  I'm psyched.  You can't see me, but I'm doing the running man right now.  God I wore out so many shoes and stubbed so many toes in the early 90's with that.  What in god's name were we thinking.  I mean dancing is supposed to be sexy (to an extent) or at least beautiful.  When was the last time you said 'WOW!  Look  at that guy, he can run in place for hours while making ear-piercing noises with his Chuck Taylor's.  That is HOT!'  Or the cabbage-patch, I used to have a friend that was all about the cabbage-patch.  I would never dance with her 'cause she was uncoordinated and I got bruised.      So we made up our own, hot-hot dance moves like: Picking-up-the-change, climbing-the-wall, locking-the-door, and other daily activities, seemingly mundane, but foxy when the envelope was pushed.  Who am I kidding, it was just to make eachother laugh.  Getting 'sexy' outta those dances was like getting water from a rock.

I don't know about the rest of you, but when I go out for a smoke I want a peaceful time to be with my thoughts, I DON'T want to make small talk with air-filter-replacing-mullet-man.  I mean what am I supposed to say 'when are you gonna wake up and smell the 'mullets-suck'.'  I mean, to some extent, they're beautiful, like all nature.  But like other critters they are to be observed occasionally for entertainment in their natural habitat, such as monster truck shows, wrestling matches, and country bars, not thrust into our world causing confusion and upheaval.  I was almost tempted to say, 'Honey, we don't talk to the help.'  What is a person to do when confronted with raw nature in an otherwise baked environment?  Do we A) nod and respond with short/noncommital phrases, or B) whip out the sheers and conduct displacement experiments?  I chose A, but B was eating away at me.  Maybe, to ensure the safety of everyone, especially the children, we should put them all on an island.    Well at least I was out there long enough to see cute firemen in uniforms.             "

This happens quite frequently.  I get kinda irked.  I don't know why.  Originally it was because I was here for a very short time.  Actually I saw the first one of them on my second day.  And since then there have been like 3 or so babies and 2 or so weddings.  I'm not made of money.  I know it's not a lot to give.  I can't figure out if that's the reason or it's just me being jealous of things that I will never have.  Go figure.  I could be that someone came by with a happy birthday sign and some candy for me yesterday.  It's not my birthday.  There is another Travis who started like last week, I guess it was his.  I didn't know they did such things here, since in my third month of working here my birthday came and left with no peanutbutter cups.  Can you still see me?  oh wait... you can't.    Sorry I'm in a funk, I think it's 'cause Im trying to get a heads up on the crest white strips 'cause I'm not gonna be home Friday, so I doubled up.  And man do my teeth hurt right now.

I think the highlight of it was playing Egyptian Rat Screw with my sister.  I'm such a loser.  But she's so wacky sometimes.  She was really getting into it.  After ever game she'd be like 'I'm getting all swetty.'  She was a slapping fiend.  But I did get to watch  Newsies  and I almost cried, I would have if I didn't think Traci would get on me for it.  I just love that movie.  Maybe it's all the cute boys (okay, a good portion of them are of legal age, the others, well that's just sick) singing and dancing, and fighting.    Also I got quite a lot of QAF in.  I'm finally to episodes I've never seen.  I've come to the realization that it's not as bad as I had originally thought.  Strangely enough the lesbians are the best actors in the bunch, and are a large part of why I continue to watch.  Okay all the naked men contribute.  But I have a HUGE problem with the whole this is Pittsburgh thing.  I mean I lived there for four years and it's not that cool.  And they talk about the Susquehanna, okay dude there are three rivers in Pittsburgh and that is not one of them.  It's like 100 miles away in Harrisburg.  They also bring up my car: 'The Audi TT is a fuck machine, the guys who drive it usually aren't.'  Well... They just haven't met me... err... yeah that's it.    Well I'll hit you back when I'm awake later in the day.    By the way, is anyone else at work, I mean it's MLK day, show some respect.  I wanna go home.             "

I don't know if it's 'cause it's such a nice day, but who the hells knows.  I surely don't.  I kinda wish I had a digital video camera 'cause the birds were around again and I wanna show y'ins 'cause it's really cool.    Oh they were talking about Heinz field today on the radio and how some of the players from some other team were told to 'mark their territory.'  So they peed on the field.  I only wish that I had peed on it when I broke in 'cause then I'd call the station and be like 'well I already marked it.'    Well that's about it right now.

Actually right now, I think due to my long commute, Im sick of quite a lot of bands, here's a short list: Creed Lenny Kravitz Red Hot Chili Peppers Jane's Addiction Smashing Pumpkins Dave Matthews Band    This is not to say that I don't like any of this music, it's just lay off the repeat.  And what is with Duncan Sheik?  Since when is  Barely Breathing  in heavy rotation?  I think I was on the East-Bumble-Fuck station.  I mean you just have to save a little of your fame for later use.  I mean we all know what happens when you overplay.  Any one of these could be you: Hootie Cranberries Spin Doctors Hanson (ewwww) TLC    Forgive me if I put any one-hit-wonders in there, I was going for one big album, one ok album, than jack.    I don't know what this rant was about, but whatever.  I can't wait to get DSL, 'cause Amazon alone has all these downloadable  songs .  Especially  The Boxer , I have no speakers at work, so I can't.  But if you do, give it a listen.  Or at least the sample.             "

But I'm feeling kinda losery 'cause I keep getting  Baby One More Time  in my head (Travis made a version of this, that's actually pretty good).  Well less than an hour 'till I get to go home.

It's big into the Irish thing, which I know is a little passe, but it's pretty darn-tootin' good.  But they're not really signed, so you can only get there CD in Richmond, which I'm not treking out there for a CD.  I'll just scour the web, when I get DSL.    So as the days progress I'm approaching definite on this apartment.  The deal is just pretty hard to pass up.    I was in Best Buy yesterday (there's a fuckin' surprise) and I got a little nervous due to my purchases.  I don't think I'm completely comfortable wearing my sexuality on my sleve, and that kinda bothers me.  I mean the way I dress it's a definite, but...  I don't know.  I just made the gayest purchase.  I bought Buffy Season 1, Newsies, Queer as Folk Season 1, and Moulin Rouge.  I mean I might as well been wearing capris pants and a midrif.  Am I a bad fag, or is my trepidation warranted?    But now it's work again.  I don't want to be here.  Just 8 more hours.  Well off to waste my youth and beauty at a computer.             "

OR.................................    Be dumb, like Melissa Rivers, and gorgeous like Mike Greybeal (or Jessica Alba for the ladies... actually she a great example, 'cause she's shit-rocks dumb)?    That's the big question, and I don't have an answer.  I would instinctively say 'I'd like to be like me,' but I would like to test out being ultra pretty.  Just for a month.  Can you imagine the ass you'd be able to get?  And maybe those stunads don't realize what it's like to have thoughts about the future, the world, politics, global warming, mandatory waiting periods for firearms acquisition, etc.    As Thomas Gray says: To each his suff'rings; all are men, Condemn'd alike to groan,—  The tender for another's pain, Th' unfeeling for his own.  Yet ah! why should they know their fate, Since sorrow never comes too late, And happiness too swiftly flies? Thought would destroy their paradise.  No more; where ignorance is bliss, 'T is folly to be wise.     And as Jessica Alba says: HUH?    Speaking of dumb my sister asked me for a review of fractions.  I started laughing at her: This comming from the girl who got one of the 2 A+'s in Criminal Procedure, I mean incredibly intelligent, but she wants a mult/div fraction lesson.  I told her to just use a calculator, and she's like 'I was going to until my friends were talking about the final saying how they couldn't believe how some stupid people brought calculators to the exam.'  She was sheepish, it was cute.               "

'cause sometimes you havn't eaten in a while, or you drank a lot of water, or you took a really big shit, what have you.  So I hope it's for real.    My morning and evening routines have gotten longer.  I'm back on the Crest White strips.  They're the kick.  I think my teeth are currently at an acceptable level of whiteness.  (they were pretty bad before I did them in November)  Now I have a week and a half left.  So that twice a day.  Then I have like 6 new facial products to use, whereas before I had 1 (if that).  Also I shave like daily now, 'cause I don't want to put all crazy skin shit on my hairy faccia.  All in all I think it's working out, but my eyes are getting more easily tired.  And thanks to Jender and Swank for recommending Bumble and Bumble.  I like the styling creme.  (WHAT A FAG!)    And with my target weight almost accomplished I think that I may be ready to start working out.  (I have an easier time losing fat than transforming fat to muscle)  I can start with a blank slate (wait, it's clean slate, blank canvas.

I'm so psyched to have HBO if I move into that place.  And MTV considering the new season of Real World starts tomorrow.    I had a Hitchcockian moment earlier today.  I go outside for a nic-break right, and there are like 200 birds perched on the other building.  Then they swoop down into the trees that line the sidewalk in like a steady stream.  It was pretty cool.  I just wish they were louder (like crows not like chirp-chirp) and it was night.  I love having 'Birds' moments.  It's so spookey and fun.  But they were gone the next time I went out.    I forgot my phone again today.  I'm such a lame-ass.    Knob-it,             "

Not because it's so rad, but because I'd have money to have fun with.    It'd save me like 5 C-notes a month.  And we all know how I like to spend.  So I'm jazzed.  Speaking of which I'm all about this line of Crate and Barrel shit.  I'm looking for some pics to link to.   Desk  and  Bed  Do ya like it?  There's also these  shelves     And my sis showed me this crap she got at Target, like desk accessories etc. that would go great.    Well I'm off to think about moving.    Oh shit...  I just noticed, the 5 shelf shelves (redundancy) are no longer available, I should go back to the store and snatch a coupla those bad boys up.  Maybe this weekend.

(Is it weird to have stipulations about how the person you live with looks?  Well I guess not so much weird, but shallow)  I don't know, It's been like 3 years since I've lived with someone I didn't know.

Now tell me what you think.  $625 (excellent), all utils including DSL and cable (right on), parking etc.  Sounds too good, well it may be.  He's 32 and his screen name involves the numbers 69.  I'm a little concerned about this.  Maybe he's just juvenile enough to think that that number is funny or something, but didn't we grow out of that in like 6th grade?  Well I mailed him back and asked some questions.  Move-in would be mid-Feb.  And on the map it looks really easy to get to from the east.    Okay on to a new subject.  My sister brought this up last night.  On Jeopardy they just say 'in the form of a question,' and they don't really expound on that, so she was like 'If I got on Jeopardy instead of saying 'What is Jupiter?' I'd say 'Is it Jupiter?''  This went back an forth until we got a little out of hand, here's some possibilities for Jeopardy answers:    Old Way: What is... an American Bulldog? Where is... Milan? Who is... Elizabeth Taylor? What is 'On Top of Old Smokey?' What is... Pizza?    New Way: Did I just run over... an American Bulldog? Do they have whorehouses in... Milan? Does anybody really care about... Elizabeth Taylor?

When I got in there  Travis  was playing on the sound system.  I was like 'Even from Heaven, Dave Thomas, you have wonderful taste.'  But then the guy charged me 50 cents for some BBQ sause.  Snot-nosed-older-than-me-yet-working-at-Wendy's ASS!    Looking back on today I think I would do things differently to be funny.  D'ya ever do that?  It's kinda annoying, 'cause you're like 'Damnnit, I coulda been funny, but instead I was a sniveling mule.'  This morning when the police officer was waving me over (he was on foot), I should have just looked at him stupidly and waved.  Pretending he was just being cordial.  Now that would've been funny.    And at Wendy's today, when that guy charged me for some topping that probably cost 30 pesetas I shoulda been like 'Dude, show some respect.  Dave Thomas died today.  Now you gotta ask yourself: What would Wendy's founder Dave Thomas Do?'    Ooh, that's a good bumper sticker, WWWFDTD.  Maybe not, it either sounds like a web site for flower delivery, or something you'd find on  Sunday Smackdown .    Well at least I'm feeling a little more up.  Maybe that's because I've decided not to stay late today, maybe not, who the fuck am I kidding, of course that's why.             "

Fuck that, I swear I was going 35, I was still in 3rd gear.  I'm going to do some internet research into the efficacy of Laser in adverse conditions.    3) I haven't heard back from the Dentist Bitch (I'm sure she's perfectly nice).    4) I may or may not be allergic to some of the skin care products I've been using; I can't stop sneezing.    5) I can't think of number 5.    6) I'm going to Jender's tonight, and without a phone have no way of letting her know what to order from Red Pepper (If you're reading this just pick something that we wrote 'good' next to)    7) Dave Thomas, Wendy's founder and friend to all grease lovers, died.

3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 I am a marketers wet dream.    I saw this little piece in Entertainment Weekly (my bible) about a line of skin care products for men.  So I decided to get some.  I've never really used any, and I'm entering my self-betterment phase of the year, so I bust out the plastic and head for the mall.    The only place I could find them was Saks, and I must say I was not really pleased with their service.  I guess the 2 foot shelf for men's skin care is not really a money maker, but honestly.  I was browsing the shelf for Zihr for like 20 minutes, and not a single querry about how my search was going.  I go to check out and the woman was helping someone else while taking my credit card, so I didn't get to ask any questions.  Meanwhile I was borderline going to buy the shaving gel if I could've gotten a price from her, but nothing, so I said no.    So I get home after dropping a sizable load of cash, and that night I wanted to use the stuff, so I had to shave first (weekends are usually razor free for my lazy ass).  My sister flipped out when she heard the water running so long, she's like 'You're shaving at midnight???'  So I started using.  I bought the undereye cream (I'm such a mo), 'cause I have a genetic predisposition for black bags (and I don't mean Prada).  So I think I have to call one of my lady friends to see how to use this stuff.  I got bottles galore each with it's 10-words-or-less instructions so I'm kinda confused.  And also I'm curious about how long before it kicks in.  I mean if you start using moisturizer is you face instantly gonna stop producing oil, or do you have a coupla days with too much?  I hope I continue to use 'cause if not there's a Benjamin down the toilet.    Also I may have found a suitable place to live.  I gotta see if this 26 yr old Dentist chick responds to my e-mail.  Cross you fingers!             "

Well not really just improving on some things I half-assed earlier.    So last night I went to Borders to get an oragami one-a-day calendar, but they were out, so I bought a Screenwriting book instead.  It's interesting, I didn't realize how structured the process is.  Now all I need is to come up with an idea.  I hope it comes to me soon.  But until then I should read the whole book before I foray into that process.  The woman at the store was like 'oh, are you a screenwriter?'  and I'm like 'no, I just needed a hobby for this month.'  I fly through things so quickly.  I'd be surprised if I'm still interested in this come The Buffy Season 1 DVD release (Jan 15th, mark your calendars).  But I like to dabble in lots of hobbies, 'cause this way I get to learn a little about a lot of industries.  It makes a well rounded person, or at least a good Trivial Pursuit player.    Well that's about it.  Later             "

Complete with sidestories, annoying secondary characters, and melodrama (the gays love their melodrama).  It was awesome.  I didn't want to wake up.

3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 Shit...    Back at work after a kicking New Year in Manhattan.  I had so much fun.  We went out like every night hang bummed all day.  But not much of it is funny beside the New Years party itself.    Well first off, do you know that there's this channel in NYC that plays  ads for porn?  It's great, but they wouldn't let me watch it.  Girls can be such prudes.  Oh and Friday night I run into an old friend from College at a bar in Union Square, I hadn't seen her in like 2 years.  NY is a lovely yet strange place.    Anywho, So we went out to the  China Club  at arount 8:30 or so.  It opened at 10, and there was no line so we went to a bar across the street for a round.  (meanwhile I had half a dozen beers at Netsie's place)  Get back in line about a half hour before the doors open, and it's FREEZING.  There was a girl in front of us smoking and I thought she looked cold, so I offered to give her one of my gloves.  So we all started talking and her other friends showed up.  One was from Birmingham, and I'm like (in my head) 'Alabama?'  But then he started talking and he was obviously from England.  So he asked us where we were from and I'm like 'Originally, Connecticut.'  Well it turns out he's staying with people from Fairfield, right near my home Trumbull.  So Glove Girl was like 'Do you know Ellen Tollman?'  and I'm like 'Yeah, I touched her breast in 6th grade.' I was off the hook.    So we get in and have a lot of fun drinking and dancing.  All of a sudden I notice that there's nobody on the Stage, so I jump on and start dancing, draging a friend with me.  So a little while after that I'm up on a block on the stage and I lose my balance.  I face-plant on stage.  Bam Bitch went down.  I was craking up so hard    Then a friend of mine wanted to go, so I made sure she knew how to get home and let her go.  Okay not my most chivalrous act, but it was like 12:30 and I wanted to partay!  About an hour or so later another one bites the dust and boots on the floor (and a little on my new shoes I might add).  So Netsie packed her up and headed for the coast.  So we were down to 3.    3 am rolls around and I can't find any of the remainder of our crew.  Finally we hook up and take off.  By this time Times Square (which we had to majorly bypass to get to the club) was now kinda empty making it a straight shot across 47th.  We make a quick stop at McDonalds.  I order a double cheeseburger meal.  When it shows up I get all pissed and am like 'There's only one!  I have two patties and one bun!  What the hell am I supposed to do?'  Well it turns out I really wanted the two cheeseburger meal, so I could share, but I was too gone to think straight.  (I have the same problem with Twin and Double beds, I can never remember which is which)    So the next day I get up at 9:20 and have to walk 12 blocks to meet my sister at my brother's place.  But with some new bruises a strained shoulder and a kicking new limp.                 "

If I get into work and there's already coffee made I start beaming.  But I always have to feel the pot 'cause sometimes it's just yesterday's afternoon coffee.

Well not really funny considering It's hard to find Engineering jobs IN cities.  And then my beautiful baby would become like a hemmorrhaging abscess on my bank account.  (dictionary.com just got like 3 hits for that one)    But all-in-all things are looking up, and settling down, after the money suck that was the holiday season.  Friday I look forward to tons-o-fun at Swank's swanky new pad.      Oh, did anyone catch the Real World Chicago thingy that was on last night.  Well it sucked, but I have a new love.  Chris the gay guy from Mass.  He's lovely.  But a recovering alcoholic, so that wouldn't really work out.  But I look forward to some hot man-on-man action this year.  Hopefully it's not lame like last year.  It's kinda sad that I still watch this.  I'm 22 you'd think I'd have my own life.  Now I have to feed vicariously off 7 losas.  Well maybe this year 6 losas and a hottie.    Off for more Coffee... Annihi-lator             "

On  WHFS  (who I think is trying to get a little edgier) they were at the Grammy's talking to porn stars, and there was either taking pictures of unclothed women or oral sex, I was switching during the commercial.  And, in the spirit of  Grand Theft Auto ,  Elliot  was talking about a game he wants to get backing for, where you're terrorists who take over the Olympics, which I think is a little too out there.  Reguardless of wether or not it's fun, I just think it's too reckless.      However I came up with a game that has edge, and also is less politically offensive.  It's called  Homeless  or maybe  Grifters  but the latter is a little more restrictive.  I'd like it to be a rags to riches adventure where it begins with some simple panhandling/pickpocketing/mugging then progressess to grifting/prostitution/robbery and from there to cock-fights/drug-trafficking/pimping and finally to wetworks/heisting/kidnapping.  And along the way your personal concerns will change as well.  In the beginning your only goal will be securing hootch and rinsing out your only pair of socks, but by the end it will be setting up an offsure bank account in Grand Cayman, and buying a mansion in a non-extradition country.

(Check out  White Stripes  -  Fell in Love with a Girl ... That's good punk)    So I had this dream where I went to my distant cousin's house for a funeral.  I was walking around talking to people, and noticing that there was a lot of inappropriate touching between men for calling hours (Is that even what it's called?).  So I'm on my cell with e ('cause that's like all I do lately).  I drop the phone and go to pick it up, but I can't hear anything anymore.  Then I hear a little 'hello-hello' comming from my water glass.  I just kept running up to people laughing and saying 'hey my friend's stuck in this glass.' - 'Say something to this woman Erica.'  Then I realize that both the microphone and the speaker of my phone are rolling around in the glass.  I shut up 'cause I feel stupid now.  Meanwhile back in the funeral of inappropriate fondling, clothes are kinda comming off and I'm perplexed.  I turn to my friend and am like, 'I'm getting the feeling that this is not so much my cousin's house as it is a gay brothel.'  I guess I got the address wrong.  Ooops.    Meanwhile back on earth.  I think I either have a food alergy or a gum inflamation.  I'm not happy with it.             "

No really, I went out last night and I have about 30 nightime don'ts for you.  So after I stupidly forgot to get tickets for the hypnotist and Jender went home I went out a bar (yeah, news to whom?).  I want to appologize to everyone I called last night.  Especially e who got a call at like 3, or as I like to call it 90 minutes into my walk home (hang on I'm getting there).    So I'm out at a bar that's playing the gayest moments in movies, or some such shit.  Like the funeral from  Steel Magnolias  the first performance from  Sister Act  etc.  I see the hottest person in the world (my fucking luck, he was a bartender, Mike... Mark... Milk...  It's not important), so I go talk to him.  Long story short I make friends with 3 really hot guys (him his boyfriend, and a friend from NYC).  At least I got to see two really hot guys kiss.    So they invite me to a club, it was fun, but I'm not sure how frequently I can take that.  This was like the hottest selection of guys I've seen in my life, but shallow like a fox.  I need to work out, 'cause just losing weight makes my skinny, but not hot.  These guys were all shirtless and gorgeous, and meanwhile I'm like 'I've had 5 hours of sleep since thursday, gimme a break.'  (So I pretty much fell asleep 4 times on the dancefloor).  Okay I think were ready for the don'ts, this story got boring.    I think the best part of going out is checking your pockets the next day... It's a veritable who's who of crap.    DON'T: 1. Don't go Out to a club with ppl. you've known for like 30 minutes, even if they're hot, 'cause they don't have your back. (okay like 2 hours is okay) 2. Don't call your friend for confirmation of your prettyness on Saturday, 'cause they ain't home, and they just get really worried and call you later when you have no idea who they are and when sequins came back into style. 3. Don't call them at 9 the next morning either, 'cause they're just mad. 4. Don't go to a club on no sleep, 'cause you ain't looking pretty. 5. Just because you see the Washington Monument does not mean you can walk home. 6. When thinking about walking home, call a cab, it's easy to romanticize but 2 hours later when you have the beer shits from the previous night it's not fun. 6. Don't question black earwax... it's just happens sometimes. 7. When your on an exodus walking home and you come across train tracks, find another way, don't hop the fence and narrowly dodge an approching train. 8. Don't 'balance-beam' on a railing 30 feet above traffic, while tango-ing with an oak. 9. Don't go out when you're still hungover, 'cause the beer shits catch up to you while you're walkin' past the Smithsonian. (worth mentioning twice.)    Okay Peace out. Live it Learn it Love it.     Note: preceding event have been exaggerated for humorous effect, I was really not in danger, even e thinks so.              "
3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 Yeah, I'm messed up, I just spent the last hour and a half staring at a chicklet,  So much has happened since last we talked.  Well I sent out my tax stuff to my dad (okay lame start, but I'm saving the good stuff for later), and instead of a return address I put:  Jo Babbydaddy He knows Where!  It made me laugh, I'm gonna have to explain ebonics to him though.  So I went out last night.  I think there's a conspiracy against gays in that people are trying to keep us drunk.  'cause when I was straight I never went to bars that had whole nights where beer was free.  I mean how spiteful can you be.  So I was there with Spark and I went to 'buy' the next round.  I find out when I get back that Goodyear asked him if we were up for a threesome.  He's like 'No, sorry.'  But to me he's like I wanted to pull out a little Karen and be like 'Tubby I don't think so.'  Me I was like I wanted to pull out a little Karen and be like: 'Aww, Honey, why don't you head over to Bob's Big Boy and pick up a leg a wing and a biscuit.  There's a threesome, that's more your speed.  HaHaHa, I'm even funny with the rabble...  I'm Chris Rock.'  Spark was cracking up and was like: 'Oh yours was much better.'  He's right you know.    So later that evening, (yeah I missed MK skate, but I'm glad I would have cried) I hit on some boys.  Most of which had boyfriends... or lovehandles.  But this one I was givin' the hungry eye to was cross room flirting.  Nothing became of it, so a few hours later I approached and was like 'I'm doing some market research.  Why didn't you respond to the eye?'  I'm totally not kidding.  I'm such an ASS!  I was T-Ravis-Rashed.  But I gathered some good info on his demo, and got a few nice compliments.  But that sucked... compliments don't play the piper.    So I get home at like 4-5-6.  Honey, I don't remember, I was too tired.  And I wake up at like 10.  All last night I was professing how I was gonna call in sick, but I didn't here I am at work.  So I drive in and I'm all about getting McD's breakfast (hungover happy).  So I pass two Don's in the Disctrict, and make my way to Annap.  I get to the one here at 10:45 and I'm like 'Are you still serving breakfast.'  The guy laughed at me and was like 'No, we stop serving at 10:30.'  I wanted to be like 'Dude, you don't have to laugh, it's 10-freakin-45, it's not like it's 3.'  So I go to pull out and low and behold little Ms. Hunchback with a dog backs into my Sgt. Hughes.  F'that.  I need to get work done now, I'd be rippin' mad if I wasn't so funny.    So I had this excuse all prepared.  'cause everyone else at work uses their kids to get outta stuff (yeah like I buy that Timmy needed to go to the 'doctor').  So I'm all ready to be like: 'Sorry, Janey had a dentist appointment and the little one got an earache, but what are you gonna do?  at that age, you just can't get mad at them.  Even though you just wanna hit them and take away their walking privledges.'  But I didn't have to use it since I got into that accident.    A coupla new things.  My favorite thing to say now when people bring up current events that I'm not familiar with is to say, 'oh I'm sorry, I don't watch straight porn.'  That and I started answering the phone by saying 'Go ahead caller, you're on the air.'  Also, and this is the best one.  I slipped up and said: 'That is so sugar.'  Instead of sweet, I think I'll keep that one.    Pop-u-later             "

My officemate is just  on  today, he's been making me laugh all morning.  When I told him about my  Daily Grind  idea (which, after a discussion with Jender last night, has incorporated personalized catalog shopping, sound cool?  Send money and I'll get it on it's feet) and he's like 'Ooh, like  The Peach Pit  and   The Peach Pit After Dark .'  Hehe.  but better yet is what just happened.  See, lately I've been havin' a hankerin' for a McD's breakfast (a BEC 'scuit to be exact), and I was talking about how they should delive.  Then I went on to tell him how someone I was talking to live in a place where they had McPizza and they dilivered.  So this is how it went down.  Keep in mind I was trying to say 'Test Market'.  (Look at me, it's like I'm setting up for a blooper.  I'm Dick Clark introducing a Carol Burnette flub)     Me:  So I was talking to someone and they had McPizza in their area, I think they lived in... ah... What's that called?  Tim:  Um... I don't know... The Czech Republic?    I cracked up.  I hope that translated well, but I'm not sure, it was one of those timing thing, Like Jender's 'Haa cha cha!!!'  this weekend.             "
3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 So did you catch Michelle Kwan's performance last night?  It was pretty good.  I was torn 'cause that was on at the exact same time that the UCONN game was winding down (FYI: they were down by 5 through like the entire 2nd half, they just couldn't protect from the 3's and giving up a lot of boards [geeze you'd almost think I was straight], but somehow things turned around when Michelle was skating, she's done so much for me [okay not too straight]).  I think I OD'd on parentheticals.  I don't know why I like Kwan so much; maybe it's 'cause I think that she's a good role model, a good symbol of America, or maybe it's because she's really my mother.  And a good showing by the other Americans going 3-4.  Woo Hoo.  That stupid Slutskaya ruined the 1-2-3.  I don't trust that girl.  She once gave me a breath mint, and I woke up 4 days later in a onesie in Georgia with a  South of the Border  sticker on my ass.    Damn I'm wierd.  I'm becomming one of those crazys (thats what we call my cousins from West Virginia).  I'm thinking of going to see a hypnotist this weekend.  He was on the radio this morning and it seemed like a lot of fun.  I'd like to participate, 'cause I think that I'm funny anyway, so maybe under the influence, I'd be a laugh riot.  People at work probably think I'm very strange, I'm chair dancing right now to  Basement Jaxx  -  Where's Your Head At , it's funny 'cause it's true.    Last night after watching a very homophobic  Blossom ... erm... I mean  Real World  and a new ep of QAF, I was flicking and put on  Darkwing Duck .  Spark got a weird look on his face, and I'm like; 'That's okay we can put something else on, I'll just watch it in 10 years when nostalgia is in.' HAHAHAHAH!!!

But now it's expanded to be a coffee shop/bar/bowling/pool etc.  (ooh, ooh, and maybe it could have like a neon strickthrough and the word Nightly, so at night the name changes)  The best part is I'd sell magazines.  Y'know how it is when you're like: 'Hey let's go get some magazines.'  And your friend is like 'Wicked idea, but where do they sell those?'  Look no further.  But it wouldn't be very successful 'cause I don't like stress, but I wouldn't mind 'cause I'd have my PB winnings.  God, why can't  I  have a failing business.  I'd also have  Trivial Pursuit  cards all around, 'cause I was at a place where they did and I thought it was cool.  What else, oh yeah, boxed wooden matched only.  Can't you picture it?  I'd call you up and say 'Come on down to  The Daily Grind ,' I'd say, 'It's half price  Corona  and  Condé Nast .'    Gotta go; I just choked on my own spit, damn I'm a moron.             "

Like I'd ever have kids.  I dried my sweater way too much.  It's tight.  Even for me.  I guess people at work will just think I'm even stranger.

Do you think I can call my mom and ask if she'll pay for it?  I mean it's for my health.  Maybe not.    I was listening to the radio this morning and they were talking about fights at supermarkets. This pharmacist said that some guy came in with a forged prescription and he refused to fill it.

I looked at myself in the mirror and I'm like: 'hey, you're skinny.'  And not just straight skinny, that's easy, but gay skinny.  So I can eat what I want now.  I think I'm still gonna stick to diet coke (damn Freud will not let me type that word cleanly) 'cause I don't wanna rebound.    Okay I'm in a better mood.

It would also detract from my less than washboard abs (or maybe it'd accent them, who knows).  So what do you think?  I'm not sure if they'd let me since my navel is pierced, maybe it's like a cart before the horse sorta thing.  But I don't know what I'd get.

This is where you'll find him at. Fighting crime like a maniac.    Does anybody else remember that commercial?  My friend Tine and I in 8th grade had a little dance to that, it involved slapping, jumping, and some tush flailing.  We'd do it in school all the time.  FLAME OUT!             "

After Buffy, he's like do you wanna check out neighborhood bars, and who am I to pass it up?  It was kinda fun, but kinda dead 'cause it was Tuesday and everything.    2 days 'til Olympic Fever!!!

It's like a Kevin Costner movie, you wait so long for it to come, and when it finally does you're pissed that you were born.    (I gotta give a shout out to my coworker for that one.

The Bud Light commercial was on where the girl was preparing the room for sex.  And she's shouting down to her husband that there's candles and satin sheets and finally Bud Light then he runs up while stripping and dives on the bed but slips out the window.  So we're all laughing 'cause it's pretty funny and Pawn was like 'It's funny 'cause it's true.'  I couldn't take it.    My best showing was probably in the car when we were talking about the show I dunno I think it's called Elimidate.  So Pawn was explaining the rules and he's like 'so there's like a guy and 5 girls...'  and I'm like 'oh, I've had that nightmare.'  Timing was perfect.    Well I gotta go now.              "

And it only gets better, 'cause I had to walk to my car this morning.  But that in and of itself was great.  I live in a city now, and walking around at 8 in the morning people are everywhere.  It's wonderful.    I had a blast yesterday.  I went with my new roomate Spark to his friends' place.  It was just cool hanging with other gay dudes.  I was cracking up the whole time, they were really funny, and I was on as well.  Not to mention that the superty-bowl was awesome.  And the couple whos house it was loved football.  Which I found cool, I like well rounded asses... I mean homos.  Every time someone would come on screen we would shout out 'hey look it's...' and then put some weird name in.  Which was really funny drunk.  The Rams coach was called everything from Wilfred Brimley to Dame Judi Dench to Marky Post to Rerun.  Add in some 'tight-end' humor and drooling over Tom Brady, it was a laugh riot.    We were talking about valentines day and if Spark should get his boy of 2 months a gift.  Pawn suggested that it not be too relationshippy.  I started cracking up 'cause I'm like 'you should get him the pro-trim, and you can be like I saw how your eyes lit up when we watched that commercial.'    Well all in all I am happy about the move.

Now I can go anytime I want, it's like I live there already... wait I paid rent, so I do live there.  Took some measurements last night, and it looks like the bed frame I want is OUT.  I'm upset, but I'll get over it.  I'm probably gonna have to do the bed in a corner thing to get the desk in there, and my sister was like 'You don't want to close it off any more with a footboard, it'll make it look even smaller.'  Fuck her for being right.  But it does save me like 4 large (is large thousand or hundred? I think it's thou, but I mean hun).  So now when I get board today at work I'm gonna cut out little shape for furniture and play puzzle with graph paper, or possibly go to target to look for plastic (I want to make this shower curtain out of 4'x8' plastic rounded rectangles that are connected with loops.  I'm thinking green with a strip of blue at the top, and one second from the bottom.  all in all it comes out to 8 rows of 18 columns.  It's like 144 pieces and 414 connections.  But I think it'll look kick-ass.  I think I'm gonna have to cut up folders or something, it's impossible to find sheets of plastic.).

3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 I was on the Connecticut Post's site, wondering about the recognition of Massachusettes' marriages in my home state.  The I came across the message board.  I was so angered by everybody's use of 'god' in defining civil law that I needed to respond.  This is what I said;   Let's not stop at denying same-sex couples the right to marry. Let's deny all people the right to marry under the law. If marriage is such a time honored religious institution then the government (state or federal) has no place to recognize it. Let's establish civil unions, blind to race, gender, etc. to establish stability in household and the rights and privileges guaranteed to present day married couples. Then the church can have its marriage; thus averting the apocalypse that so many people have been referring to. And the religious right can continue along its morally superior, discriminatory, path to save us all. Religion has no place dictating the lives and lawful actions of those in a society founded on the principle of religious freedom. That it is already ingrained in our everyday lives is not a sound argument for perpetuating it's presence. The only purpose it serves is to alienate those who do not believe in the Judeo-Christian establishment, thus infringing on their religious freedom. Government should be secularized and god should be removed from the public sphere.             "

On the site people have been recounting their testing experience and trying to remember any question they can.  Through this I think I have built a false hope that my score is good, since I always seem to get the answer ppl on the forum think is correct.  Which is cool, but now I'm nervous.  To top it off (and not in the good way) I have heard from numerous sources that they hod gotten their scores early.  This kinda frightens me since I was prepared for them showing up on the 6th.  Oh well, we'll see. Cross your fingers and hope for Travey.             "
3176655,male,24,Engineering,Libra,"03,July,2004","                 I'm finally home, well at work.  After a grueling weekend.  I'll lay it down for you.  Firday I do (almost) a full day of work.  And get a ride to the airport at about 8 (car).  This I hop on my 35 minute flight to Newark (plane; yeah I know, it was dumb, but flyi.com doesn't start flying to JFK till next month or something).  After taxiing and everything it took about 2 hours.  Then I hop on a shuttle to Grand Central Station (bus), the Jersey transit system , in their infinite wisdom, decided that only one lane was required for entrance into New York City.  So my 35 minute bus ride took 2 hours.  I get to the train station and look for the next train, well this was convenient, there was only one left.  I had missed the 11:22, and the 12:22 so it's the 1:30 for me.  I don't know if any of you have taken the 1:30 outta GCT, but unless you're intoxicated it's not fun.  It's like the drunk tank at county (does anyone know what county is?  Just sounded like somthing Perry Mason would say, or better yet, Matlock).  To top this off there was a Phish concert in NYC.  And if you know anything about me, you know I don't like Phish.  So me on a train with a bunch of drunk and high kids.  To top it off, the 1:30 makes EVERY stop through to Connecticut, so my 45 minute ride (train) took 2 hours.  Finally I roll into Trumbull at 3:30 and get to sleep.... 'till 9.  Saturday was nice, the wedding was pretty and stuff.  I really wasn't feeling the Catholic sercive, although who does. 'Honor' this, and 'serve' that, and 'make him a cheese sammich woman.'  The reception was cool, very Italian, but I ended up making friends with a cousin of mine that I haven't seen in like 8 to 10 years.  She's cool.  Danced like a fucking freak, caught holy hell for that the rest of the weekend.  But 'sall good, when the three of us (Todd, Traci and I) get together it's in good fun.  Went to bed at like 2... 'till 6.  Sunday was really cool.  Went to the U.S. Open, not really a golf fan, but the weather was incredible and it's just overall a cool experience.  Kinda bummed that Phil doubled the 17th, but ehh... there was some good golf played.  This is a conversation I had with my brother's fiancewhile whatching some guys put on the 16th green.  Meg: Where's the hole? Trav: Megan you gotta remember these thing, jeeze. Meg: Do you know where the hole is? Trav: I got a couple ideas.  We got outta there at like 7:45, crammed 4 people in the back of my sister's Pathfinder.  And started a horrible trip through long island.  4 hours later (and about 50 miles), we roll into Manhattan and drop off Todd and Megan.  Then we trade off and each drive a bit.  My shift came on at 1:30 and was the last leg.  I was so tired, being in the sun all day and all.  Finally roll in at about 3:30.  All in all, horrible trip, but some perspective; it still was shorter than my trip up there... and I flew.             "

I don't want to go out on a limb and predict my score, but I think that I'll be at least comfortable with it.  The testing environment was much better then Oct. '02 when I last took it.  This time I think I'm ready to make the plunge, hopefully I can get in to the schools I want though.  But I have 3 weeks to obsess about how I did, and you know me.  I've already established a Y! group to try to compile everyone's memory of the exam so we can see if we got questions correct.  So far I've gotten most of them right, but I'm not sure about this one about 'Health Education' and Propaganda.  Anywho, that's all I got to say about that.  On another note I've been talking with this really kick guy on IM (but he know's about this site, so I won't go into detail about this...  if you want the skinny you can contact me ;) ).

JOhn was always angery about the dumbest stuff. one day he disobeyed his parents and turned on the t.v.(john wasnt alowed to watch t.v b/c it made him even madder.)so he turned the t.v to station 8. POKeMON was on. John got soo mad at the charaters,plots, and pokemon. he got so mad that he got up and got this dads golden gun and went down stairs and then he got so mad that his special ablity, transportation, came upon him. he was then transported to the world of pokemon. creepy. so he went around the 'crazy forest' and short wild pokemon. SO then 3 days latter,john, was getting pretty fed up of eating pokemon so he went out of the forest and desided to find Ash(the star of the t.v series) he found him playing with pikahu on a park bench in the city. he walk up to ASH with the gun. ASH, who had never seen a gun or gold before in his life. Ash asked him if was a fancy mustard holder. John(of course)said,'yeah, of course it is u loser'. so Ash being very hungery took the golden and stuck it in this mouth and shot it. Ash died with a smile on his face-because of his love for mustard.ummm.mustard. so then pikahu sat here laughing-cuz he had always hated ask but just never expressed it. for pikahu was a weed/heroin dealer-and had been slipping ASH huge amounts of cystal-meth ever since they had met. but Ash had become amune to it so it had no effect. so then pikahu said in a deep,big voice-said,'lets get outta here and have the time of our life!'. so john transported him and pikahu out of the t.v in time for dinner. FROM then on john kept pikahu in his closet and made him be his slave rat for the rest of his pokemon life(which is forever)(unless shot.) AT age 101 John was on his deathbed with pikahu chaned to this side(pikahu was cleaning the bedpans)(of course) with the last bit of effort John took out the golden-gun and told pikahu,'i am taken u with me,haha'.Pikahu said'o cccrap..iii' Bang they both died at the same time but he dint even use a bullet. thats because in the door why, stood the secert agent-MR.Linscott!but he had only used one bullet!and they both had been shot. and the romm was like john on bed-picahu on light stand-next to the bed and mr.s standing infront of them both.! the end.STORY OVER KIDDIES!(TALKING BEGINS AND HANDS RAISE) -----------------------------------------------------------------     **John Reed-{raises his had and says},'Mr.LINSCOTT that makes no cents-it would have been impossable.Stop using my name in every story, its getting so old.   **MR.LINSCOTT-{leans back in chair and smiles at john in a gay shorta way)Sweety,IT makes total  cents are u blinded.IT in my NEW book i just wrote, so it must be true'.{wink};)       **JohnReed-Nasty,No my door doesnt go that way.The story it just makes no cents{leans back in chair and begins playing tetris again.       ****DitzyBlondeGirL-tell us another story.How about the tiger story!!!!!please,please. awww come on.    **Danielle-not again, its so fake-make it stop.       **Caitlin-he is such a major crotch goblin.      **Mr.LInscott-have i told u the one about the pokemon.

Master Seaworld being a reasonable man... said 'not today Myran, I'm excectionally tired and want rest'. So Myran got mad and ran away... but came back an hour or two later. MAster Seaworld was still exsosted from his trip... but that didn't stop Myran... he ran up and jumped on his bed screaming 'I want Pan Cakes' Finally master S got up and made pan cakes and slept on the couch while watching he favoritist show ever!

3667495,male,15,Science,Libra,"24,June,2004","                 There once was a baby named Bo Jangles. When he was born his parents were told that he was blind, but Bo wasn't blind. The doctors were foreign, and they believed that he was blind because of this really light colored eyes. While growing up he tryed to convince his parents that he wasnt blind, but they would never listen. So he started to pretend he was blind. The only person that believed him was a kid named JohnReed. Both of their fathers were highly involved in the  MOb.(organized crime) While JOhn's dad was the boss. Bo's dad was the right hand man. So there familys were really good friends.(Like family) One day JOhn was making fun of Bo's blindness by throwing a apple at Bo at a mob meeting. BO,not being blind,caught it.Then john asked bo what color his hair was. Bo was like brown 'freak'. John realized how cool Bo was and they became best friends.  They were kinda stupid.Yeah so they got like lost a whole bunch. So one day Bo Jangles and JohnReed were on there way to the gas station to pick up some tacos. They desided to take a short cut throw the corn field. And geuss what??? they got lost. so they started going throw the corn rows when all of a sudden they spoted a sign. It read dont mess with the crotch-goblins. John Reed siad,'Caitlin Kyle,this girl @ school is always talking about those things.' AlL of a sudden a C-GOB bounced on BO Jangles head and hiss at him. Bo, took the C-GOB and took it off his head and took a bite out of it. 'Taste like some sorta weirdness'. 'I dont think u should have ate that,stupid',said JohnRxxd.'I dont care', Bo said. All of a sudden there was a nosie coming from the corn rows. 'WHAT DID U DO TO MY C-GOB!!' It WAS CAITLIN!! 'Hey caitlin!',said John. Hey john. n/m Which one of u ate the c-gob. did u realize that was the last one left? bO SIAD,'SOrry i didnt realize it.' caitlin runs over to bO and beats him up. Caitlin then realizing that it didnt really matter ask them why they are in the midddle of a corn field. John answers,' we were on a qwest for tacos but we got really lost!!'.'I can i join i think i could help.?',saids caitlin. They answer yes and continue on there mission.Day turned to night and they began to get tierd. THey could barely see anything when they walked rightt into a man. The man was really tall. Bo took out this keyring flashlight and tapped on this back. the man turned around. It was BoB the janitor.WHat the heck?'Mr. bob .What are u doing in the corn field. Very simple,Mr.reed.I am Jeepers Creepers. I am inside of bob, u know using his body!!! 'Really',said Bo. 'Since U have found out my secert i will send u one person to help u'. The 3 kids huddle togther to think of a person. We want       .'O wAIT i ONLY NOW one person. i only have one friend. i meet this girl playing on-line bingo a while ago. i told her i had no friends and she told me that she would be my friend,. i WILL SEND HER to u!'Thanks' they siad. All of A SUDDEN a girl appears and jeepers creepers flys away. 'It cant be,Danielle?',says john. 'Aww, one mintue i am in bed the next in this corn field.'You all have some explaining to do'. THEY expalined all to danielle. 'So i geuss i am stuck with u guys', saids danielle.I geuss its not all that bad.  They continued. After a while they all got disscouraged and begun to believe they were lost 4ever. But while walking through the corn field caitlin tripped over a bar typed object, it was a water spicket. they all took a drink . and then all went to sleep. the next day when they woke up, they figured out that the wtare had been magical! tHey all had turned mult-colored. iT was so weird. bUT the effect wasnt perment. thanx goodness. They continued on there qwest. they found a small shack. they all could barely fit into it. it was filled with cotton candy. There was a little boy inside, he had big bug eyes and he also had lazyeyes. so one eye was on the cotton and the other on the unexpected geust. The boy said in a small voice,' yOU WILL FOREVER re-main in this house for life.' All of a sudden The doors and windows dissappeared into nothing and they all; look at each other in puzzlement'. 'What are we going to do?'said bo. I do know?? 'I know i am eating some of this great candy',said danielle. good idea. they all sit and eat the candy. The boy then explains how he got lost one day and found the house and has been stuck in there for the last 12 years. 'wow' 'that is amazing' 'i guess we will be here 4ever then.' yeah. at least we arnt alone. yeah. 'are parents are going to be freaked'. It will be okay i think. 'I love cotton candy'..,saids danielle. 'yeah',they all said'. 4the next 100 years they ate  cotton candy and played 20 qwuestions. but they did in the end go insane and become addiccted to bark.         "

3667495,male,15,Science,Libra,"26,June,2004","                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ A LONG time ago. Like 2 days ago. There was this guy named johnreed. johnreed he was a character. hE WAS walking outside at 4:30 in the morning on MARION ave. which is a never-ending road! Well he was walking along the road when all of a sudden a guy in a pink and blue tractor-trailer pulled up beside him and blew a dart of poison into this neck. The man got out of his car and pulled john into the car and took him home. JOhn woke up 13 hours later with a horrible headache. The first thing he saw was the figure of a man wearing a purple suit.” who are you', john still dizzy asked. 'My name,MR. Rxxd, is Sam Kingostopper'. 'But U can call me Kingo, all my closest friends doo'!.John says, now getting jumpy, 'What am doing here'!!!!!! 'This has to be some shorta joke!' 'Where am I'? KINGO replys,'u are in the ghetto.' 'There are no ghettos'!,  JOHN REPLYS. 'That is a ignorant thing to say fool”, said KINGO. 'Stop playin word games with meee!'Says john. 'IM NOT PLAYIN WORD GAMES WITH YOU'. All of a sudden kingo forces john to lick a poisoness frog. john passes out and hits the floor.Kingo goes back to playing with his pet lobster, named bunny. john wakes up a day later, remmbering what had happened.O CRAPz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'MR. jOHNrEEd u have finally woken up, u had a very long and pleasent nappy-sleppy-sleppy.' john said,' cut to the case, why am i here.' 'its very simple,mr.reed, i kiddnapped you becasue i need your help',kingo says. 'Ok, I will help u just stopp druggin me, it isnt very nice', john reply. 'Alright, just stopp yellin and caring on like a crazy hamster under shock hearpy', relpys kingo. JOHn takes a deep breath and leans back in the chair. 'Ok lay it on me!' Kingo stepps back and sits down on the sofa,'ok i need u to brush Bunny's teeth'. 'WHAT??????', JOHN REPLYS. 'Who is Bunny and why do u wANt me to do that.'  Kingo looks a john and picks up bunny, 'bUNNY is the name of my losbter'.. 'oh ok phyco', repleys john. 'ok stop makin fun of me mr.reed, do u wanna lick the frog again??', replys kingo. 'O no, anything but that, i just dont understand, why cant u do it ur self?? 'very go qwestion, i have a allergy toward toothpaste, kingo says while crying. 'Stop that u look like a pansy',tells john reed. 'please mr.johnreed, (looks and hugs the lobster)bunny doesnt want to get a cavity, do u bunny??!!'. 'fine, after this will u let me go home, i have to watch the si-fi channel, there is a show without guns on tonighT', replys john. 'fair enough, or u could live there!', said kingo getting mighty excited,(jumping up and down like a little girl) ' we can sing NICK NACK PATTY WACK all day long.!!' NO no just let me do this and then take me home', john replys with wide eyes . KIngo hands the lobster to john and a small toothbrush just big enough for a lobster. it only take john about 5mins to brush the lobsters discolored teeth. 'done',says john. 'great job mr.johnreed', says kingo full of gratitude. 'I will take u home know but i must  drug u one more time. i dont want anyone finding out where i live!', kingo says while looking thorugh some boxes. all of a sudden the man takes out a vial of blue liquid, and shouts,'fair larwence lives on 4ever!!!' john looks up in dissbelief,'I will drink it, it is the only way to get away from this crazy insane man!!' john falls to the ground.  · 3 hours later john wakes up in the driveway of this home, dizzy. His dad is standing over him. Myron says,'i told u no drugs jon, this is very dissapointing.' .'but dad i didnt do drugs, i was kiddnapped.' 'i dont believe u, why would soemone kiddnapp u, thats why you are taking kun fu, so u dont get taken by anyone.' john stammers out,' but itys not kun fu'!! 'no i dont care what it is , get up stairs u are grounded for the next 3 weeks, and u are going to get spanked  100 times with a seat belt!!' 'great'. john returns to the kichen woundering weather he had dreamed the whole thing or if he really did meet the crazy man named kingo. 'o yeah by the why john,  meet the mayor of mansfield, he needs my help with  his job', says john dad, 'mr. kingostopper'. john turns white, kingos and johns eyes meet and john runs up to his room screaming and then gets into the fetal position and shakes. Back down stairs johns dad explains that john is on cyrstal meth and he screamed becasue that is how he says hello.' Kingo gives a chuckle a takes a sipp of tomato soup,'i dought that, he seemed like a very nice and useful young man'. 'whatever, so u need money, and i am a lown shark, so just tell me what u need'. All of a sudden Mryon is shot in the neck with a poisoness arrow by kingo, and he is dragged away. kingo says with a huge grin on his face,'THE MADDNESS WILL NEVER END,AWAWWWWWW'!!! **BEWARE**** **RED-RUMM** BY:DANIELLE C-2004-fishy isn’t it??

The group was comprized of many tpyes of people but they all had cross eyes and they all wanted to find out who had killed Fiar Larwence.all they really did at the meetings was get really drunk and sing elton john songs. the group would most likely get into fights and claim that raddishes would take over the u.s. so they went to jail a lot. but it was all County Paris's fault b/c he though it would be a good idea to get drunk at the local bar. But in reality county paris just liked to get real drunk,bEAcuze he missed his really old friend, Fiar Larwence. he had been shearching the internet for rumors of he fiars death. AND one night had mad a big big break through. the group was meeting at the local bar and the County was sitting down with this wirerless laptop. he typed the words' i killed fiar larwence' on ask.com. the county had been in luck, there had been a website made that day that had to deal with someone claiming to have killed county paris. 'what a dumb person',paris declared. 'lets go you guys, he is in mansfield ohio.'. 'lets kill him,hahahhahahah!!!' They hitched a ride with a gay truck driver. so it took them 5 days to get to mansfield and when they did they had to find the man who had done it. so they askeda round and round tryed to tap peoples phone. one day they jusrt happened to be on marion ave and there car broke down. so they all walked up the closest house on the road from were there car was. County pARis knocked on the door and a strange friendly guy answered the door. 'ummm our car broke down,good man could you please be a dear and let me use ur phone?''' 'the name is myron,and no u cant because i deep fryed the phone this morning,s o it doesnt work.' 'but if u would like to come inside and have dinner with my family i would be trilled' paris said', ok that is very nice, do u have enough room for all 12 of us?? myron said,'we can have dinner outside.' come in mr.???'.'the name is county paris, no mr.'...'mr.countyParis, what a cool name' myron said. 'Fool, no mr. just county  paRIS/.' 'I asure u that i am not making fun of u,' myron declared. 'crazyeyes'. 'WHAT, no u ddint!',said paris. all of a sudden mr.johnreed walks down stairs and looks that the 2 poeple fighting. 'john go make dinner, we are going to have a picnic!!'.'ohhh oki will get out the tomato soup!!', ummmm, declares john. 'hes on crystal meth he doesnt know what he is saying.', myron relpys. 'ok',wishpers paris,'they u dont know a man by the name fiar larwence do u?'

3667495,male,15,Science,Libra,"17,July,2004","                   so there they were in the cotton candy shack. just bo jangles, mr.johnreed, caitlin, danielle, and the weird little kid.ever since they had been trapped in the shack, their brains had been on over drive trying to think of a way out of there. but of course the naughty bo jangles wasnt thinking cuz he was withdrawing from pot and cuz he is dumb. bo wasnt helping at all cuz he kept saying here was like no way out and that they would all die. and all of a sudden out of no where they started to hear the jeepers creepers song, so of course they got a little freaked out, cuz who wouldn't.but danielle assured them that jeepers creepers wasnt going to hurt them, but instead help them. bo jangles, being his stubborn self, didn’t believe what danielle was saying. so bo got on the ground and started to gnaw on the bark floors and chant ignorant things. so caitlin went over to him and slapped him silly. so, of course, jeepers creepers showed up and brunt holes into the shack, with his eyes. in no time there was a hole big enough for everyone to get through. but jeepers creepers sensed fear in the little boy and he liked his bladder so he had to the little kid against the will of the others. but jeepers creepers, who was not bob anymore but a Canadian organ grinder. so the group thanked jeepers for getting them out and he flew away into the sky.{bye-bye:(*tear*...} so they returned to the qwest to find tacos. about 30 mins later bo jangles gave out a scream of pain. he had been bitten by a bug. johnreed, being an expert on bug bites, had seen this rare bite before. it was called a boss bug and if it isnt cured it could turn into amy's disease, which john had done a prodject on before. since they didnt have a can of tuna or a cacti they were going to have to let bo go through the horrible disease.so what else could they do, aww yes, return on their adventure. after an hour or so bo became,well to be very blunt, BOSSY. really bossy. he was telling everyone what to do and all of that kinda of stuff. so everyone decide to plot against him and put oragel in this mouth(which would make it num and stop him from talking.) john tricked him into drinking the whole bottle by telling him it was toothpaste and that his breath smelled really bad. being so full of himself he took it all in. after he had done so he looked like he was retarded. so they were still wondering through the corn field, but much faster,cuz bo couldnt tell everyone he needed to go to the bathroom every 10 mins, so he peed his pants a lot. then out of nowhere, in the middle of the corn field, was a tall man, who was about 7' 6 and was wearing a black trench coat and his hair was gelled back. he looked troubled or like he was in shreah for something very important. the group approached the man. they asked if they could help with anything. the man asked if they had seen e.t. , his long lost son. caitlin brust out into laughter and told the man, pointing to john, that john was e.t. john tried to tell him he wasnt, but the man wasnt going to take no as an answer. the man told john that he just wanted to make sure he was ok and that he wanted to make sure that e.t was happy on earth. john said yes. the man kissed and hugged john and then said,'fairwell son, and good day!!' john was pretty weirder out but he passed it off. by time the man had left the numbing gel had worn off and bo jangles began to act like his bossy self once again.but not only was he being bossy, his ego began to grow bigger and bigger. it was the size of a hot air balloon. he started to say that he was better then everyone else. so everyone was getting pretty hungry, and to their surprise in the middle, what would lie, but a meatloaf restaurant. when they walked they noticed the banner above their head it stated that the meatloaf was magical and that it was abundant and free. so they sat down for a wonderful feast of meatloaf, when, u guessed it, bo jangles began to fight with john. saying that he could eat more meatloaf then john. so bo,of coursed, challenged john to a meat loaf eating contest. john accepted because he is johnreed the kun-fu master that will never turn down a challenge. so they had the contest,. bo ate 15 loaves and john ate 3. so bo jangles went around celebrating his victory over john. but soon he got sick and puked out all 15 loaves of meatloaf. everyone started to laugh except bo who started to cry and he had a pity party for himself, nobody else joined cuz:-1. they were eating magical cheesecake and real cherries from the garden outside.and-2. bo smelled really bad. so after the cheese cake and the party was over they continued on their journey.&nbsp; after a while bo was so over whelmed that he fell into to the ground and began to say really crazy thongs about mongooses. so john being john had a little talk with him about his attitude. but bo&nbsp; wouldn't comply so john poked a presser point on him and they left bo jangles to die in the corn field of never ending corn..&nbsp; without the presence of bo jangle the group seemed to be doing alot better then they had been doing. u get the point. as the day turned to night they got tired and made corn beds like the Indians made and they fell asleep. they were awoken the next morning by the screams of john, he had had a bird poop on this face, which was really nasty and gross. but he wiped it off with a cob of, u guessed right, corn! so after a breakfast of creamy corn(by the way john had begun to get a yellow tint to his skin.,lol)they continued on the qwest,it wasnt to long before the corn ended and a street was now in front of peeps. they started to walk down the road when they noticed an ALDI's grocery store. they walked in looking for someone&nbsp; so they could ask where the heck they were. but as soon as they walked in who else would appear but the naughty, egotistic BO JANGLES.&nbsp; everyone was in shock. how did he manage to get to the store before they did.l bo jangles explained that as soon as they leaf him aliens abducted him and did weird things to him, like put silly putty in his brain and dye his liver purple. but that they had to stop and get some raisins .so they let him go cuz they were done with him. besides the fact that no body believed in him. but they were pretty mad at him so it really didnt matter. so bo had a dollar so he bought a bottle of ketchup. because he liked ketchup. and john remembered that he had a dollar in his shoe so he bought a container of&nbsp; mixed nuts that were also meat flavored.(how convenient for john,lol.) so they left the store while the girls were still trying to figure out where they were. but nobody seemed to know. so they left in disappointment while angry drug users tried to sell them street drugs and highway streets. but danielle insisted that they had 2 of everything. so as the girls pushed the crazy people out of the way, they rejoined the guys who were enjoying their treats. bo opened the ketchup bottle and took some in and spit it back out, cuz it was horrible. it tasted like crap. so bo jangles marched back into the store and complained about it to the person in charge. the sales worker took out a pistol and told bo to get out of the store if he didnt want 2 unwanted presents. bo sulked out the store and he shunned the store. he came out while the girls were making fun of johns mixed nuts. john, being an awful nice person, offered to share his new found treasure. but everyone declined, even bo,who would get anything. it made john kinda mad, but the wonderful taste of the meat flavored mixed nuts made him forget about his sorrow.&nbsp; while walking&nbsp; down the long street john decided that it was time for a sing along, so he took out his banjo keyring but bo that it was a ghetto idea and then insulted john by telling him that he was really ghetto. john, not like being called ghetto for any reason, got mad and bit off 2 of bo's fingers and ate them. bo was in a world of pain. not to mention that the blood was everywhere. but nothing could really be done. bo, in a word, was handicapped and mad.(i wounded why??) so danielle and caitlin played doctor and wrapped up bo's flesh wound. but somewhere in the middle danielle went over to talk to john about the word'ghetto'. which didnt make john to happy. soon the 2 were fighting over ghettos:real or made up. but they came to a tie b/c danille changed the subject to bo. john still mad said he was sorry to bo.&nbsp; but bo was still really mad at john for what he had done, so he wasnt talking to him. so what else could they do but continue on there qwest.bo still upset started to sing the song,'stacy's mom.' over and over again. everyone thought it was kinda weird and sick, but nothing else could make the sad boy happy. so then john got mad b/c he saw a pile of rocks and he got depressed b/c he thought even a rock whould reject.the girls tried to tell him different and hold him that he was not acting rash. so then about 2 days passed when they came across a road that intersected with the one they were on. the road was named ocean ave. john got really excited and started to jump and scream and lose control of everything. john finally got control and told his peeps that road ended in his back yard, and it was only about 4 miles, and that they were going to be home by night time. and was good because they were tired of liven in the presence of corn and need to take a bath. esp. bo jangles b/c he smelled of puke and ketchup. so they skipped home. and when they got there all of there parents where there and they all acted like nothing had happened.which was weird. but nobody wanted to ask qwestion. the only person that had gotten in trouble was john b/c all of the parents had come up with this crazy idea that john had kidnapped all of them. so john couldnt watch the sci-fi channel or any other channel(except weather) for a year. cuz he must have seen the prank on some movie. and nobody wanted to get into trouble so they just agreed that was what had happened. so they all made it home safely never to tell what had happened! I think the only qwestion was, did bo and john make up?? well thats a story for another time.  by:danielle c-2004. holla.!!!!! &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;        "

3486574,female,15,Student,Gemini,"29,May,2004","         Hmm...it's been a while since I ever use a blog again. Kind of lose the last blogger that I used last time. Hehe, never mind. Shall start over again.  Haiz..today is the 'Meet Parents' Day'. And of course, i'm included. (as usual though coz almost everybody else have to go) Miraculously, my father decided to sent me n my mother to school...(it is unusual of him to do that, since he always prefers staying at home and sleep all his want since it is a day off for him as it's the holidays for the students, and he need not teach) Well, it's been raining ever since I woke up. And it only stops until now. The weather is kind of cool...pretty good for time to take a nap...Felt like cuddling up my pillow n goes to sleep..Haha. But alas! I've to go to school in such a weather. And redeem my results slip.  Cool as it is, bright as it seems...but there'isnt alot of students around that time...Guess every other students chooses a time as early as 10 to collect theirs...and only a couple of unlucky teens (like me) choose such a time where everyone is back at home, watching tvs and enjoying themselves...11.45 am is the time.   The first thing i saw when I entered the school...was DT! With 3 other pupils...Yep, all 3 of them are from my class...Dont know what's up with them...and DT...As far as I know, they must have commited something wrong that DT wanted to see all 3 of them. And from their faces, they aren't looking kinda good. Trying not to be nosey, I dragged my mom to my class...where Mr Wong (my form teacher) is.   Well, guess we were the last ones to be seen...There's someone in there...someone familiar...Ok, it's my sort of father's sister's son. (Well, I dont know how to call it, a long-distance relative, maybe?) Anyway, he was there...together with his...erm mother. At first glance, I thought it was my aunt. but then again when they came out, it was not. It took about 15 minutes for them before they come out from that room. And when they came out, his mother greeted my mom. And then when we entered, the first thing mr Wong said wad 'Your related one ar?' And I nodded...  And here it goes....my result slip. It doesn't looks pretty nice...I failed 2 subjects. Haiz...Oh well, guess I've to buck up for my final year..just like what I did last year! I aimed to get back my position for Top 10! Muahahahaha... I've noticed....I always get a pretty lousy results for Mid Year Examinations....and only when Final Year, then my results are of the better. This year, I'm not going to let my parents down either! Afterall, it's an important year! =D  Mr Wong goes on and on about how I can improve on it...and I'm determined to prove that I can do well...and I am made of something! Lolx.. He even suggested me to buy the Ten Year Series books to practise on. And oh yeah, he even asked for my home number...I sure hoped he won't call when I'm least expected. After all, I'm a good student!   Yawn...it's 3pm now..Guess I've got to stop. Today's kind of ok. I'm so bored with nothing to do now...Maybe I should go back on reading the comics...And I just can't wait for tomorrow! Haha, coz I'm going out to redeem the Jolin's Concert Tickets...Well let's hope that at least I could get them.   Laters!           "
3486574,female,15,Student,Gemini,"30,May,2004","       Haiz...today planning to go orchard to redeem my Jolin's Mini Concert tickets...Never know that there will be so many people redeeming it. I went out at noon...then when we reach there, it was around 1pm.. And when we got there..i am utterly shocked! There's already a LONG queue there...God, why am I always so 'sway'? But then, I was prepared for the worst...I knew even if i queue up together with the others, i definitely doesn't stand a chance....so, forget it. =[  And just to make myself feel better..I decided to catch a movie! Yep! And I wanted to watch the Day After Tomorrow..but Jiali wanted Shrek2...then we decided to see which movie comes first and decided on which one to watch. And in the end, Shrek 2 shows at 1.30pm and DAT is at 2pm...and I was like, 'Oh man...' Then I started to begged her on watch DAT instead. Then after some convincing, hehehe, I finally talked her into watch Day After Tomorrow instead! (Woohoo~) JiaLi rulez!! (LOlx)  Anyway, as I was saying...we bought the tickets and we have about an hour's time before the movie starts so we went to isetan (which is just below the cinema) and shop around. Haha, we've been to many departments...and like I said, there's a doll which looks REALLy like Jiali! Muahahaha..(oops hope she isn't reading this)and I told her that and she totally disagress with me..  Anyway, we went to the stationary department and I finally found the BLACK shaker!! Hehehehehe!! Well, I know I am wasting money but this is the only way to make me feel better after the loss of the 2 tickets for the Jolin's concert. And time flies, it is almost 2pm when the shows going to start. So we decided to go and make the preparations (like buying popcorns...lolx) And then we finally entered the cinema.  Wow! The show's REALLy awesome! It's the best movie I ever watched!! And Jiali even wanted for the toilet...but i told her not to go. Coz if she were to leave her seat, at any point of time, it's gonna be another great scene that she missed! And finally she tolerate through the whole movie. And it's absolutely a nice movie! So stimulating and romantic(for some parts). Especially how the girl hugs Sam when he was freezing cold after coming up from basement. And the most thrilling part is when the HUGE WAVES of seawater came rushing down to the city! And everyone is running for help...except for the girl who tries to help the old lady getting back her passport...Then Sam came to her resuce...and they are safe and sound! It's really a cool movie!! Like whaT DT have said...Haha  After coming out of the theatre, the first thing we did was rush to the toilet! And God! we didnt even manage to finish the popcorn! We left about 1/2 of the popcorns..coz both of us were to full to continue eating. And after sometimes, I keep talking to her that how great the movie is! And I am SO proud of myself that I told her to watch DAT instead of Shrek! Hehe, no la. Just kidding...lolx  Anyway, later we went over to heeren and planning to go over there and do some shopping..But then as I passed by popular, i decided to stop by and buy a couple of assesment books for myself. Coz my grades really have gone down! And I must do something about it this June Holidays!! Haiz...that means it's still looks like schooling for me...  After that, we went over to heeren...and on the way, jiali stomach pain...Told her to go toilet first liao, she dun listen..Like I always said 'Whenever you need a toilet you cant find one, whenever you dont need one, it keeps appearing' And I was absolutely right about this! She refused to go at first, and when we walked half way and about to heeren, she suddenly stomach pain! Then she say she can't stand it and have to go for the toilets. And luckily we reached there and she took quite a while before she comes out. And I was starting to get bored too, lolx!   Finally, we went to HMV...I was looking for the Marykate and Ashley's VCD..hoping that the price will go down. But instead, the VCD is gone! Haiz...sway lor..I guess. Then forget it, we headed for the bus and went back to BukitMerah Interchange to buy me and my mom's dinner. And then we went back home.  Oh yeah! I forgot that I need to buy the Lime Magazine where this month features quite a lot of my favourite people in it! Great! Really sway ar, today!!! Forget it!  Haiz...  Oh well, me go have dinner liao...  Laters!!         "
3486574,female,15,Student,Gemini,"31,May,2004","       Wahhhh!! I cant believe I am SOoO unlucky! Remember yesterday I said that I was going to Orchard to redemm my tickets? Well, yeah indeed! There's leftovers for the tickets in the hello! shop. I got the news from an email sent by my online friends. They said that they came even at 4 something(which was the time when I went there again the second time)and they could redemm the tickets without fear! Argh!!  I thought with such a queue, surely the tickets have been out like hotcakes! But no! And worst of all, they can choose whatever they want! Not according to the amount of people! And most of the people chooses other merchandise like the DVD and posters and the passes. That's why there's so many leftover tickets! But then again, when I read on with the email, I realize something! No wonder the people don't want the tickets! If they had the tickets, they have to apply for a new line! And that means they have to spend more money for a pair of tickets,and it is not worth it at all! That's why almost everyone want something else!  Geez, now that I know the truth about it,I wasn't that upset over it. Coz even if I got the tickets, I couldnt have gone to the concert without applying for another line. Moreover, I've already got the DVD..I dont see why I need another one. And for the passes, erm I dont kinda have the time to queue up with those fans to get just the autograph of Jolin! So, I think I will pass up that too! Lastly, for the LIMITED edition Poster...it's kind of waste though..But still then again, even if i got the poster, i would just throw it one side like the poster doesn't exist. So, after all these serious thinking, I wasn't THAT depress on them.   Afterall, the best thing is, I've had a wonderful time in Orchard! That's the most important thing...                                      ************   Oh yeah! I got the news from a friend in the japanese exchange program that May and her partner got a tiff over something. Ha! Serve May right! (Hey, I'm not being mean here. But she really deserve that! Since she've been acting all the while! Trying to be teacher's pet. Though she still failed. And always acting cute! I can't stand people of this kind!) And god, she even cried! (Muahahahahaha!!!) My friend did absolutely the right thing! Ha! Know what she did? She actually treat my friend as HER maid! She kept ordering her to do things for her when my friend herself needed to do her own. And she even wanted my friend to help her keep her dirty clothes while she bathe! How could she! And that's not her first time, according to my friend. That's why my friend could tolerate no more and quarrel with her! (Good job! Hehe!)  And she even dare to complained all that to E and A (shortforms..) Then they told my friend about it. That's how she learnt that. And for 2 solid days, whenever May wanted to talk to my friend, she ignored her. (Wee!! Way to go!!)I bet May definitely doesn't have a good time in japan! Hahahaha!! That's something glad to hear. And to think she was still looking so forward to it! This should teach her a lesson!   Oh well..I've to go now..Going to catch my favourite tv shows.. Lolx  Laters!!         "
3486574,female,15,Student,Gemini,"23,July,2004","        Ugh! I'm damn sway...Havent been writing for awhile lately eh? Haha   Early in the morning, go down the road to hop on my father's car, and nearly tripped on a couple of 'invisible' stones! It is camouflage in the grass by the way...that's why I didnt notice it. And somehow it is still early and of 'coz the sun hasn't risen and neither could I see clearly...That's how, I almost fell...  Luckily I regain my balance as soon...and my father also grabbed me just in time (My knight in shiny armor) Lolx... Well, first thing in the morning nearly tripped...What more comes next? Yeah, I know there's bound to be loads more install for me! And I was quite right if you ask me!  When I got to school...everything was still allright until the last 2 periods! First was the Chinese, our Chinese teacher told us that we're not allow to use the dictionary 'coz we already know what's coming out for the test, so she forbid us from using it. And then she didnt turn up today for our test, but the test still is carried out somehow, with another teacher of course. And fair enough, we got the same topic and (hehe I've memorise everything, though I've changed some of the words 'coz I can't seem to remember all...OoPs) I started it quickly...'coz we dont have much time after we came back from the Com Lab...and it left us about 20 minutes to complete it instead of 35!  But half way through, the teacher told us we can use the dictionary! My mouth dropped open! I thought 'Didnt she told us we cannot use it? How come now can use??' Oh&nbsp; well, after all I've memorise most of them, there's no further need for me to get a dictionary now...since there isnt much to be look up in the dictionary. So I quickly finish the letter writing, and was the second to finish, but wasn't the second to hand it in...'Coz I dont want to hand up a piece of work with mistakes! So I counter check it.  Then, the teacher broke out the news that we are having another letter writing test on the upcoming Tuesday...and this time it is the formal type. And we are asked to learn the format ourselves. But as she is kind, she decided to go through with us on behalf of our teacher. And we were asked to stay back after school for 10 minutes to go through it...that wasn't so bad. But the worst has yet to come!  She decided to run to ask the HOD of Chinese Department whether she can ownself conduct the extra lessons with us and then when she ask whether she can trust us on not copying when she leaves...and she choose to trust us! I couldnt believe that! And when she left, everyone started to take out their papers and copy...until she came back. And everyone manages to finish it somehow...not all though. -_-'  Chemistry is the next lesson....I hate it! 'Coz that teacher totally sucks! He teaches so quickly and when students ask questions about it, he will yell at them! How weird! And he always like to pass sarcastic remarks on those he dislike! Thanks god, he dont dislike me...He actually treat my classmate a ghost! And he likes to give nicks to anyone he hates! And sway...when he tested us on the Equations, I got picked! 'Coz I was 16! And 15 didnt come! So he decided on 16! Then i go up, shaking....dont know what to write. I look around asking for help. Got some help from some of them, and then he decided that we can get help from someone...and if we cant complete it by today, all of us have to stay back!   Inorder to get everyone safely back home, I quickly ask the Chemistry Experts! True enough, I got the answers...but whether or not it's right he didnt say. But for the other team, he didnt got it right, and somehow have to stay back for detention. I thought he was going to say 'Who was the other one that was up there, that couldnt answer the question just now?'(me) But I was standing there, praying hard he won't. And whew! He didnt!  I think he either forgotten about me or I really did get the right answers. Haha...  Kinda sway today right? But I cant wait for Sunday! 'Coz I'd be going to the library and borrow some cool books home..And I cant wait for Wednesday Night either! 'Coz my brother is coming back! And then, I can finally get my hands on the gifts he is bringing back! Hehe...I sure hope he got the things I like...  Okay.   Laters!!          "

From Ross Halfin's Diary on his website:  Thought I'd have a lazy Sunday. Checked my diary and realised the person who does it hasn't put any recent pictures up.....I'll rectify this today. Speak to Phil Collen, haven't spoken to him in a year, he tells me there's a Def Leppard Greatest Hits CD coming out for Christmas (again) and a rock version of Vault. He thinks the record company are flogging a dead horse and he's had nothing to do with it. He's in London for a couple of weeks. Told him Joe had played me the covers album they'd done....Phil seemed very disheartened by it all....I must say they've done a great version of Rock On by David Essex (won't tell you the rest as it'll spoil it).  1. Def Leppard Greatest Hits CD 2. Rock version of Vault (or does he mean the above is a rock version of Vault) 3. Covers album  Why would they release 3 all round about the same time, although not sure when the cover album is due, they ought to call one of em Dazed and Confused cause I know I am lol.  Kate.

1240631,male,41,Communications-Media,Libra,"24,June,2004","       For shear genius,  urlLink Foucault's Pendulum  swings ellispse's around  The Da Vinci Code . The protagonists of Foucault's Pendulum try to prove a point that the afficiandos of the Knights Templar would believe anything...so they make up their own phenomenal history of man--complete with prophesies and death rituals. They soon find themselves pulled into the maddening world of cultists and true believers...and, of course, satanic death rituals.  For genius and plot  Foucault's Pendulum  stands heads above the Code, yet it suffers one fault: The book is long and tedious. I suspect if I really got into masonic writings and long conspiracy theories, I would find it all long and tedious as well. Three quarters of the way through the book, I was fed up with all the cultist idiocies, and just wanted the book to end. There's a large number of people who would believe anything you stuff under their chin...now get to the end....please.  It is interesting the way that people really want to believe in big plots and grand theological conspiracies. Even more interesting is the way that many people really want to play a part in the great fictional dramas. They kidnap young girls, they fly planes into buildings because they feel they have to somehow be a praxis in the grand social movements of time. They read pieces of fiction with their eyes curled up as they ride Trax to the towering granite ediface in the center of town believing that it will give them some secret hidden powers over their enemies. (For those who are wondering. If you ride inbound Trax you will often see people reading a strange book with their eyes curled up as they try to conjure the hidden powers between the words of the book. I was watching one of these creature one day. The creature was literally shaking as he read. He suddenly developed the most sinister grin on his face that I had ever witnessed. The creature closed his eyes and lipped the words he found...ingraining them in his memory. I was obviously witnessing the birth of a great political strike against this creature's enemies. The creature got off at the towering granite ediface stop.  There are times when I really question why I live in the place where I live. I like the mountains and deserts, but I really have a hard time working for people ruled by revelation.  Back to fiction. In many ways, I agree with Orson Scott Card that Science Fiction really is one of the best formats for exploring theological concepts. When accepted as fiction, the format really lets our minds explore different ideas. We can connect absurdities like Umberto Eco. The open acknowledgement of a scifi book as fiction lets us see different ideas without the precept of having to take them for anything more than entertainment. The method works best for people who see all of the wonderously different ideas that can exists.  Fiction can open our eyes to the way the world works because fiction allows the author the ability to really focus in on ideas that nonfiction lacks.  Yet there is also a strange point where cultism, theology, guruism and pure fiction collide. This is what I find troubling. We create a fiction, then people build on that fiction. They destroy that which does not fit in their world, etc..  I guess I should mention, when I was reading Foucault's Pendulum, I had a rather dull witted boss. He could not understand the ending of the book. Caught up in the strange cult history portrayed by the book, he could not understand why Umberto Eco ended the book THAT WAY!!!!  Could there have been any other way? The ending seemed obvious from the first page. There was just the game of connecting dots and seeing just how the predictible ending would come about.  In this regard, the plot of the Da Vinci thriller was better designed. We did not know the true identity of the grand villian until the last chapter. More of a thriller, the ending was quite interesting in that after the villian was unveiled, all of the strange creatures in the book turned out to be normal people...while the ending of Foulcault's Pendulum comes off as a let down. Even worse, some of the 'normal people' suddenly seem like monsters.         "
1240631,male,41,Communications-Media,Libra,"23,June,2004","       I finally read the  urlLink Da Vinci Code . It was a fun fast paced read. It was much better than  Digital Fortress .   In the Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown put together a nice coherent plot, likeable characters and enough controversy to get people talking. Apparently, people are eating the book up. It has been in print for over a year and there is still a waiting list at the library and used copies of the book have not dropped to the dollar level which generally happens as a best sellers move into the yesterday news category.  Overall, I found the book a fun work of fiction that provided some interesting insights into my favorite characters of history.  I do have to admit. In many ways, I am turned off by the message from many pop books and movies that paganism is somehow a superior (more rational and or more balanced) form of spirituality than christianity.   Yet, overall, I think the primary message of the book was on target. The book gives a strong reminder that the victors tend to rewrite history. Trying to actually base our life on any form of ancient writing is rather foolish as ancient writings have been seriously manipulated throughout the years.  The political forces of the dark ages led to a systematic destruction of the science and culture of the ancient Greeks. The destruction was similar to what we saw the Taliban doing in Afghanistan and we see the Islamic clerics doing in Iran. In order to add more legitimacy to one set of books and icons, there is a concerted effort to destroy other competing systems of thought.  As for people destroying history for religious reasons, here in Utah we actually have an extremely large and powerful University that actively works to falsely interpret the history of the Maya, Aztecs and other native Americans to fit what is, most likely, a fictional account of the Americas.  To add an element of conflict to the Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown gives the reader the grand daddy of all conflicts...the conflict between man and women. The primary premise of the book is that the Vatican has conspired to destroy the sacred female. The priory of sion is actively engaged in trying to preserve the ancient religious texts that hold a different role for women.  The idea of a central conflict ruling the entire history of mankind is extremely compelling. This is much like what Hegel was doing with his Philosophy of History. He had the world moving through these thesis/antithesis conflicts. Claiming to be a scientist, and claiming his conflicts were scientific, Hegel gave the world a very compelling history.  Having fictional scholars speak authoratively on a controversial subject is a strong literary device. I can see why the book shelves are now full of refutations of the Da Vinci Code as the different fictional accounts of history battle eachother for supremacy.   As for real history. A few days ago I saw the tale end of an interview by Richard Rubenstein for a work called  Aristotle's Children . I placed an order for the book, and am looking forward to its arrival on my doorstep.  If we really want to look at fundamental conflicts at the foundation of society, I think that looking at the ebb and flow of interest in logic is far more telling indicator of the progress of civilization that the conflicts of religion. It seems to me that when there is a due appreciation of logic, the society rises. When the society is dominated by revelation and mumbo jumbo...it declines.         "

Everything I've seen has got my bogus meters flashing full.  The main gist of the 9/11 commissiont is that there was just too much of that freedom thing going down in the United States and now we a more powerful centralized police to protect the nation's interests. Yep, their&nbsp;conclusion seems to be to do unto the US what Al Quaida wished to do unto the US...curtail freedom.  The report claims that 9/11 was a failure of the imagination. Then they go on to report that the security experts&nbsp;are now&nbsp;imagining things much worse than 9/11 . The implication is that we are much greater danger because security experts are imagining more.   If anything, there is an reverse relation to what the security experts imagine and our overall safety. The fact that people are much more attentive has increased security.  Now, the fact that we are actively&nbsp;engaged in a war means that security risks are greater. What the experts are, or are not imagining does not dictate the extent to which the US enemies wish to do us harm. The experts' imaginations affect their attentiveness. It does not affect the sentiment of Al Quaida.  The big failure of the pre 9/11 world was not the lack of centralization of security forces, nor even the imaginations of security experts. It is the fact that the US and the western world had turned a blind eye to the oppressive regimes, overpopulation and disaffection of&nbsp;the Islamic world.  If the puppet governments in Iraq and Afghanistan simply turn into the corrupt nepotistic regimes that the US has installed in the past, then we have two new breeding grounds for anti American terrorists...just as the corrupt Saudi Arabia was the breeding ground for the 9/11 terrorists.  If we end up with states like those put in place by George Bush the first, then America is in deep trouble...between now and the next war, the technology gap is likely to lessen.          "

I enjoy being way out on an empty country road cycling by myself grooving with nature. I never really understood why there were teams, or why people bothered competing.  Quite frankly, in recent years, I've been extremely turned off by the Utah Mountain Cylcling scene ( urlLink iMoab.com ) which is into this extreme 'tear up the desert' free falls down the face of cliffs. Yes, mountain bikes can do as much damage to the wilderness as a jeep...or a stick of dynamite. I tend to limit my mountain biking to roads. Trail ride does too much damage to a trail. The mountain bike is the best way to experience canyonlands or the swell...but there's enough roads already in existence. I don't need to carve a new one with my fat tires.

1240631,male,41,Communications-Media,Libra,"06,August,2004","       Oil prices hit historic highs. The stock market seems to be in a free fall as a the result.  The one biggest fault that I find with the Bush administration is that it is not using this increase in oil prices to push for long term reduction in our use of oil.  Conservation is not simply about having less...it is about structuring our lives so that we get the absolute most from the resources that we consume. In this regard, I think the steady increase in gas prices is actually healthy for the economy since it is focussing people's attention on efficiency. For that matter, one of the first jobs I had was to use information technology to help reduce the fuel consumption of a fleet of trucks. The rising cost of a resource created a need for people to figure out how to get more from the resources consumed.  I also had temp jobs in construction. The firms I worked for were actively eying the cost of materials. When the cost of wood was high, they would employ people to salvage the wood. When it was low, the wood added to the landfills. Pulling nails from lumber is not the best job, but it is worthwhile in that it shows a tendency to maximize the return from invested resources as the price of the resource rose.  I think it is the nature of humans to become destructive when the price of resources is too low.  Anyway, hopefully the rise in the price of fuel is getting people to think about ways to realign their lives and businesses to be less dependent on oil. Is is possible to shorten the commute? Or perhaps it is possible to own two cars: a economy car for every day travel, then the gas guzzling jeep for rare excursions?  Sadly, our fearless leader is not really taking this opportunity to push long term conservation. Oil prices are rising and Bush's circle of oil buddies are getting richer than ever. Bush looks at the economy. His circle of friends is getting richer than ever before. Nothing wrong here!!!!!!!  As for my get rich quick schemes (I really should call these a get to minimum wage quick scheme), I've added a  urlLink Back to School  page and a  urlLink Earth Friendly  products page to the various web sites.

Well they couldn’t be farther from the truth because that is  false.    Here is the truth…      Skills and experience within your profession aren’t what  gets candidates the job. The truth is that there are too  many candidates with the proper skills and experience to get  the job, and ONLY one usually gets the job.       Companies are looking for more than skills and  experience these days. So it’s extremely important that you  all your individual characteristics mirror your passion.    So what are the other factors that are usually invisible to  candidates?   **Self-Awareness** – who are you and where are you going?  What are your plans for the present and the future? How do  you know what you want? How do you know that you’re right  for this job? Employers want to make sure that you’re not  lost.   **Learning Skills** – Are you willing to learn? Are you  current on trends and technology? Are you a person who loves  to “grow” within their profession? You want to show an  employer that you’re a candidate that learns in order to  progress your career.    **Adaptability** - With everything changing so rapidly  today, it’s possible that tomorrow your skills may no longer  be relevant. Are you a person who adapts well to change?   **Character** - Do you show passion in your industry,  because when you do, it projects through your résumé, cover  letter, and especially during the interview. An employer  wants a dependable trustworthy employee. The more you  project your positive character, the better!        You can have a huge advantage over your competition by  going one step. Create a career portfolio and within it make  sure that you showcase all the categories above in the  proper manner. I guarantee that this will give you a major  edge over your competition.        So you see that it’s not all about skills and  experience. It’s really important that you consider the  factors above, because them alone can get you the job.     =========================================================== David Green is an author and hiring manager of Distinguish  Marketing, LLC.

3711014,male,24,BusinessServices,Cancer,"09,July,2004","       Emailing may seem simple, but there are some complications that you need to be aware of, otherwise, your email may never be read by an employer.   1.) Your subject line is crucial…   How would you like the employer to be drooling to read your résumé? Of course you would, right? Because that will increase the likelihood that the employer will read you whole cover letter and résumé.   Note: An employer usually takes 10 – 15 seconds to overview a cover letter and read it.   It is to your advantage that they completely absorb your cover letter and résumé. The subject line of to your email can create this urgency, this excitement, and this greed within the emotions of an employer.   To give you proof of what I just said, what motivates you to read most of the articles that you like to read? I bet it’s the headline. Nine times out of ten, if the headline doesn’t interest you, then you won’t read it.   It’s no different with an employer…they are human just like you. We read what we want to read and what we read usually strikes our interest.   Tips on writing a magnetic headline:   ** Write a subject line addressing the company needs, NOT yours.  Ex. I have ___accomplishments to provide value toward ____ position   ** Put the employer’s name in the subject line (notice the cliff hanger as well…)  Ex. Hi Dave, I love your product and I would like to work for…   ** Stir the employer’s emotions by teasing them with value.  Ex. Here is how can increase your sales by 8%  Ex. How would you like a lawyer who has won 98% of the time!  Ex. I am used to communicating with dozens of people who recommend me to other friends.   3.) Houston we have a problem with spam filters   According to Time Magazine, between 40-70% of all email is getting killed (Spam Filtered) BEFORE anyone has a chance to read it? It’s true!   You may think an employer is getting an email but nope it never reaches the email inbox because the spam filters stole it like a thief in the night.   What can you do to make sure your email arrives to an employer?   You have a choice. You can ask if the company uses a spam filter or you can assume that they do. I don’t know the exact statistic for the exact number of companies that use spam filters, but I would make an educated guess that it’s 50% at least.   I would say that your best bet would be to prepare for the spam filter. The spam filters have a point system. Now usually when a email has more than 5 points then your email will ether not make it to the inbox or it will be place in the spam filter folder.   To give you an example on how the point system words: If you have “Free” anywhere in your message and especially in the subject line, you will receive 2 points automatically. There are many words that trigger points, and its way too long and boring to go through all of them. So here is…   A free resource which detects your point system of an email:   lyris.com/contentchecker   3.) How should I send my résumé?   Before I begin writing about how to send your résumé it is critical that you ALWAYS include a cover letter with your résumé. That’s right, even when you send it through email.   You actually have a choice. You can send your résumé and cover letter in the body of the email, or as an attachment.   Beware! Sending your résumé as an attachment could cause it to be scrambled or lose it format structure during its journey. This means that an employer wouldn’t be able to read or have trouble reading your résumé. So how can prevent this from happening?   Send an email to yourself. Go to msn.com and yahoo.com to get a free email account from each. Then send your résumé and cover letter from one to another and see whether your résumé and cover letter are formatted correctly.   Should I send my résumé and cover letter in the body of the email or as an attachment? I recommend that you do both. That way you know the employer will be able to read it, no matter what.   Check with the email content checker above and see whether your email with the attachment has under 5 points. If not, then I recommend that you send two emails to the employer’s inbox. The first has the attachment and cover letter and resume in the body of the email as well. Then send another email with just the cover letter and resume in the body of the email.   ========================================================  David Green is an author and hiring manager of Distinguish  Marketing, LLC.

What have you done that very few have done in your industry?  What can and what will you provide on a guaranteed basics?        These are all questions that employers want to see within you. The job of the employer is often tough because they have to search to find out what’s within an individual. The employer or recruiter has to search if nothing stands out to be beneficial to the job. Most employers are to mature to go hide and go seek, so don’t hide behind the tree.          The key is to make yourself into a shining bright light like the sun if you will.

A well-prepared portfolio that provides 'evidence' to an employer of your accomplishments, skills, abilities--it documents the scope and quality of your experience and training in the proper manner.

Looking over hundreds of applicants, they always have a problem. Which is a major problem…they have no idea which individual has the best package to deliver.        That’s why there is an interview to choose that one person. Who is the person that gets the job? The individual who show the most “Proof” that they can get the job done.  What shows “Proof” to the highest degree during a job search? Without hesitation it’s a well organized career portfolio.        Employer Moto: You can have the skill and have plenty of experience, but you still have to prove that you’re worthy of the job.    2.) Are you waiting for a Promotion?       A popular question in the job industry is how can I get a promotion or how can I get promoted faster? Here is the simple reply to that question…      Create a Career Portfolio that exemplifies your skills, experience, and most important accomplishments. Let me ask you a question: Why should you get promoted if you can’t at least “show” what you have accomplished?      Your reply to this question may be “they should already know since I’ve been working there for so long.” This is not the case. The bottom line is this… companies don’t record what you have accomplished. They just evaluate whether you’re doing the job or not.       Your accomplishments probably go way beyond what you have done for the company. And guess what…your company or association definitely doesn’t know about that. So always keep a record of everything that can be tied to your profession.   3.) Are you in need of a raise in salary?      Who wouldn’t love to receive a raise? The real question that you need to answer is “Why should you receive a raise in salary? One of the hardest aspects of a career is getting that raise.       The more value you bring to a company or association, the more you get paid. You can have the skills and experience, but that still doesn’t answer the question: Why should I give you a raise?      Here is the solution to getting a raise. You have to prove to the company that you can provide more revenue or value then a normal individual. Just to give you one quick tip on how to distinguish your value from others… create a career portfolio and within that portfolio compare your skills to other people who work in your industry.       That way you eliminate the work for the employer.

The person who goes an extra mile by doing the unnecessary. It’s the person who goes above and beyond by doing something different or unique.        We have been playing by the same job search methods for years. But I found out a startling pattern with the people who bend these traditional methods.       The traditional methods are creating a resume, cover letter, or filling out a job application. Is there a law that states that you must not go beyond these methods? Of course not, I recommend that you do more by striving for what you want.        I guarantee that you will get noticed just from being unique. Now I’m not saying just do anything to get the employer or company attention. You want to think of create of ways that you can show that value that you will provide or the accomplishments and results that you have accomplished in your track record.   Let me give you a few examples that are rarely used:   ** Spice up your resume or cover letter by including a testimonial.        Have a current or past employer give you a testimonial based on your skills and accomplishments. I’m telling you that this will strike the interest of any one who reads your resume or cover letter.  ** Come in with a plan.       Nothing rocks a company’s or employer’s boat like a person who comes in with a plan that will increase the company or association’s revenue or productivity.        Take a moment and brainstorm some ideas that could improve the value of the company you are applying for. It will be well worth your time and effort.      ** Be included within the top 5% by the follow-up.        Yes, about 95% of job seekers usually don’t follow up. Remember that companies hardly ever hire a person in just a few days. It takes weeks to fill a position.        So guess who the employer will remember the most when the time comes to hire that one individual. It’s that person who has multiple exposures. Always remember that our human mind stores much easier from repetition…so don’t be afraid to follow up.  ** You can really crush the competition with a career portfolio.        Yes, it doesn’t matter what industry you’re part of, you can create a career portfolio even if you haven’t been working for long.        Your portfolio doesn’t have to be about how you perceive yourself.

3168577,male,23,indUnk,Sagittarius,"20,April,2004","       Wow, what a nice concert. The Texas A&M small ensemble class was performing some classical pieces and one contemporary classical as I might say today in St. Mary's Catholic Church. I was first bored to death hearing the 'not-so-coherently-played' flutes, clarinets, oboe and stuff played at the beginning of the concert. Just as I was thinking of leaving the concert, well I was also trying to decide whether I'm going to kneel and making a cross sign when I leave or not since I was in the church, but not in a mass, so there I was sitting so everly confused and bored with all those tutty-futty flutes and clarinets. Then just as I build my strength to get up, the music proffesor introduce the last group of ensemble, which is the 'TROMBONE ENSEMBLE'. I was like, WOOOWWW, forget the kneeling, forget me leaving, cause I'm staying..urrgghhh, I'm so boring. Then!!!, this trombone ensemble start to play, man, eight trombone players, set like a whole orchestra with the high, middle, and low arrangement thing. GODD, the play took me back to my junior and high school time. I remember just how fun it was to play my trombone with thw whole brass section....anyway, the last repertoire thay played was a jazz music. Ok, it's jazz and trombone, together, heck, I'm staying till the end of the show. Maybe I should've read the program before the show, anyway, the piece was perfect. I was clapping, without thinking like when I was deciding to kneel or not. Then, I went to talk with one of the trombone player. So then I decided, I'll take the class this summer, however, I still have to look for a slide trombone, since my trombone is a valve kind. Shoot, I wish my birthday was in May.     "

The theme that day was about honoring grandparents. So at the end of the sermon this new priest I don't even know his name told us to say in our heart the name of our own grandparents. Now I see a problem. I only know my paternal grandmother. I've never met my mother's parents and my father's father. I'm trying really hard to remember any of their names. I remembered my father's grandfather's name, Johannes, which is really rare for an Indonesian name. I think it's because at that time Catholic has become a common religion in the area where my father came from so they started using their baptist name. So I went home while trying hard to remember my grandfather's name. Today, while browsing at my sister's happily neglected web site, I found this Tarombo, which is the family tree from my father's side. So I hurriedly look at the name of my grandfather, I read it and I found it to be another european name, but right next to it his Indonesian name is written in parenthesis, Raja Doli, which is my middle name. Since I came to America, I've never used my middle name anywhere, or just put an initial anytime I need to fill a form requiring my middle name, so it's been five years not hearing people calling me with my middle name, except whenever I meet this Brazilian friend of mine who calls me by my full name everytime we meet. But I hardly ever meet that guy anymore. Now I remember that my father told me when I was a kid that my grandfather gave me his name. I used to ignore that story, but now I see the story in totally different way.      "

When somebody told me a joke about how you can get around when you meet an old friend but forgot their name, so you say '..so how do you spell your name' and your old friend would say ' B O B ', and you say ' ahh...I thought there was a hidden M there', I was thinking of using it whenever I meet old friends without having any idea of what their names are. However, there is an exception on this bad habit of mine after I finished reading 'Me Talk Pretty One Day' by David Sedaris. This book is so hilarious that whenever I found myself laughing in the lab while waiting for some experiments, I turn to the first page and read the author's name again 'so what's his name?'. After finish readig the book, I've been rereading the author's name for hundreds of time, hence I can finally remember the author's name.

Once the peps and shrimps look happy (bam!) add some green bellpepper and some vegetable ( those with lots of leaves types of vegetable), after chopping them into bite sizes.  Beat two eggs together and put into the pep, shrimp, bellpepper and vegetable mix. Add some more seasoning if you like. If you have limes, squeeze half of the lime to get the juice right on top of the sauteeing stuffs, just to give a bit of a kick!  Look around in your fridge, if you have some cheese (laughing cow cheese is the best) throw some of them into the pan just before you turn the heat off so they melt beautifully.  In another pan, steam some baby carrot.

My lab is in the 9th floor, which means everyday I passed the 6th floor using the elevator. Since I'm a chemical engineering student, while most of the people in Richardson are petroleum student, I don't know what really happened to the guy. Last night around 10 PM, I dropped by the lab to get some samples to do SEM on and left the lab around 11 PM. When I got into the elevator I looked at the digits indicating the floor you're passing on the elevator door. Somehow, I started to think about the incident as I watch the digits changing and it has been a habit for me to count the floors all the way to where I'm going. So it went from 9, 8, 7 and then it stopped at 6. I waited as the elevator door slided open. I think I kind of close my eyes halfway and try to blur my vision so that I won't really absorbed the spookiness or any specter flying around, I know I felt really stupid. Than the door opened perfectly and a man came in. His feet touched the floor. I was like, pheew....hahaha. I asked him if he knew anything about the news, he said yes. He said all the people in that floor try not to go into the room used to be the guy's office. It's just a sad news for people to chose to stop their live for whatever reason. I know there are a lot of obstacles, pressures and other problems people encounter and we sure will in this life, but there should be some options, even just one option, for people to chose other than killing themselves to lessen the burden they're having.

I didn't have a chance to take my dinner before we went off to Houston. During the game I didn't buy any food in the stadium. Jamie brought a plastic bag full of candies that keeps all of us happy during the game (it's kinda slow for me and there only was one homerun by the Astros and they switch the pitcher, Clemens, in the middle of the game, but still it's interesting)So yesterday I just ate four candies, drank a bottle of milk and a bagel for lunch and one plate of egg salad after I got home. So I was pretty much starvig when I went to bed. Whenever I feel hungry while I'm sleeping, I always dream about eating some foods and wake up feeling even hungrier. Last night was kinda a different dream. I dream of eating my home country food with my family and I started eating the food with silverwear but after a while I use my hand to eat the food instead of the silverwear, and it felt really good. I guess I was hungry and homesick at the same time. The good thing is I'll get to visit my home country this fall, yeeee...great foods.    "

This sounds like I might be the only student trainer at the game tomorrow...  If Wes is no longer going to be the Varsity trainer (and I'm therefore the only one), it'll be interesting to see how games after this week are handled. If we win this series, we'll have games on days that I'm in summer school. Games that are after 1:10 (or that I have to leave for after that time) won't be a problem, but I don't know how State will work if we go that far since I doubt I can miss (at least) 2 days of summer school to go to wherever those games will be played.

No exams, but we have to be there for attendance purposes. Today I have my Computer Science AP class; I think we're watching  Harry Potter and CoS  for the two hour exam period. At least I'm taking my Xbox and that DVD up to the school with that intent. My guess is that 5 kids out of our class will show up. Granted, that's an extremely high percentage when we only have a little over 10 anyway, but we'll see.  Another baseball game tonight, and no one thinks it is important enough to tell the trainer when it's time for the bus to leave. 5:00? 5:30? 4:00? I've been told all those times, all by different people. My guess is somewhere between 5:00-5:30, so that's when I'm showing up. If the bus is gone and I get in trouble for it, it's not like there was ever a consensus on when I was supposed to show up. If I do end up going, it will be close to 11:00 before I get home (game ends ~9:30, 1 hour drive home, then cleaning up the stuff and actually driving to my house).  Well, I guess that's about it.

GPRS and EDGE have allowed people to get on the internet anywhere that they can get a digital cellphone connection. Take the availability of cellphone networks, replace the necessity for a cellphone with a wireless card (much like 802.11a/b/g), and up the speed to almost twice that of a T3 connection:   that's  802.16 .  This isn't the only new technology that's competing to be the next thing home users will use for their internet connection, but with speeds and convenience on this level, whatever technology end up becoming widely adopted will take the internet to a whole new level.

I remember about 1-2 years ago when this technology was first starting to be advertised by manufacturers, but one of the major problems then was that products made by two different companies were not guaranteed to (and often didn't) work with each other. Just another example of why I think standards are one of the best things that can happen in the tech industry.  The uses for Bluetooth are very impressive even though it is only considered a 'wire replacement'. Have a laptop and cell phone both enabled with Bluetooth? Instant wireless modem via either GPRS or EDGE. Bluetooth headset? Acts as a speaker on pretty much anything that makes sound.  More and more products on the market are staring to incorporate Bluetooth, and I wouldn't be surprised if eventually every single peripheral is completely wireless via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or some other wireless standard.

I had Subway for lunch on Monday, and Thursday was the first time I could manage to even look at my computer monitor since then. I'm still not completely better (although I can eat pretty much whatever I want to now), and every once in a while I'll have issues walking straight or standing up since I'm still a little dizzy. Oh well, at least it's better than spending over 2 full days doing nothing but lying in my bed. Summer and I really need to have a talk about what I'm supposed to be able to do and how I'm supposed to feel (Hint: This isn't one of them).         "
1550279,male,17,Student,Sagittarius,"18,June,2004","             Yep, I'm done with all 14 days of summer school now and (hopefully) have credit for Communication Applications (Speech) now. Nothing left for me to do this summer except sleep, play video games, and go watch movies. Oh yeah, and hopefully be able to update this more often than once per week.         "
1550279,male,17,Student,Sagittarius,"13,June,2004","             3 speeches in a week should not be allowed. But unfortunately it is, so that took up the majority of my time this past week. Friday I saw  The Chronicles of Riddick  (which surprised me by being a pretty good movie, more on that tomorrow) and worked on my grandparents' computer. Then I had to take the ACT yesterday, go work on 2 different people's computers, and then today I went back to my grandparents to show them how to use the computer after I made the changes to it on Friday. Tomorrow I begin my last week of summer school (which hopefully won't involve a lot of speeches). Life? Lighten up a little.....please.         "
1550279,male,17,Student,Sagittarius,"08,June,2004","             Yeah, been a few days since I updated. Lots of stuff going on, though. Anyway, let me think about what's happened...  Yesterday I had to give my speech over HDTV. I think it went pretty will; everyone seemed to enjoy it, and someone in my class even told another one of my friends how good it was. I get to give another one tomorrow over King Tut which has to make use of a visual aid. Hopefully that one will go just as well.  Tonight I tried to log into Star Wars Galaxies to play (even though I don't particularly like the game and enjoy playing FFXI much more), but I ran into an interesting problem. Somehow my account has been cancelled, and I know that I'm not the one that did it. My only guess is that Sony cancelled it after an inactivity period (of what, 3 weeks??), so they got an email from me tonight asking them to 'un-cancel' it. There's probably not a great chance that I'd be renewing my account anyway once my current subscription expires, but if I have to jump through hoops to get my account activated again, there's no way that I'm going to be playing this game that much longer.  Oh yeah, and there's been way too much rain here recently. Make it stop!!         "
1550279,male,17,Student,Sagittarius,"05,June,2004","             Yep, this is been a '1,2,3' weekend for me (as indicated by the topic title). Now for some more in depth discussion of each of these things:   1 Week of Summer School Down:  Friday marked the end of my first week of summer school (and the equivalent of the end of the 1st 6 Weeks). My first real speech is on Monday, so I have to finish preparing for it over the weekend. It has to be an informative speech with no visual aid, so I decided to do it over HDTVs. My second one will be on Wednesday which is an informative speeck with a visual aid, and I think I'll do that one on either the Egyptian Pyramids or the Sphinx.   2 SAT II Tests:  Today I took my first two SAT II tests, Writing and Mat IIC. I could have done a third, but I didn't feel like doing Spanish and there was no way I was going to do Physics. I'll probably do 1 or 2 more at the start of next school year.   3 for 3 on HP Movies:   Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban  definitely gets two thumbs up from me. It left out quite a bit that was in the book, but since most everyone that is going to see the movies has already read the book, the stuff they left out was fine. I don't know if I would say it was better than the second one (Chamber of Secrets), but there's no way it was worse.  That about covers my weekend so far. Nothing big planned for tomorrow except for working on my speeches, but who knows what could pop up at the last moment.         "
1550279,male,17,Student,Sagittarius,"03,June,2004","             So, I get out of summer school today to go eat lunch. Wendy's, long line; Whataburger, long line; Chick-Fil-A,  extremely  long line; McDonald's, 4 cars? Maybe they're having problems due to the massive power outages we've been having, but I went over there since I figured I could get my food faster.   Yeah, it went faster, but I was very impressed by the system they have set up. Instead of using the normal speaker, there were 2 women standing outside with PDAs in their hands. 2 cars at a time would give their order, and it would be transmitted wirelessly into the kitchen. Then, they had a manager with a money belt standing near the first window so that both cars could pay at the same time. Then, each of the cars head to the second window to get their food right as the next set of cars is coming around. No wonder there's no line, even Chick-Fil-A's dual lane system doesn't work as well (or else they're about 100x as popular).  Still, the point remains that I think this is an awesome use of technology and that more restaurants should make use of features like this. Not just fast food, but also places like Chili's and other sit-down restaurants. Waiter is ready to take your order? He sends it back to the kitchen to speed up the process. Need a refill on that drink? Give something to the customers so that they can signal when they need one. If restaurants started to embrace technology with ideas like this, I'd gladly pay a few extra dollars each time I went there to help support the costs. 10 years from now, no telling how we'll be getting our food, but I can assure you that it will rely on technology much more than it does now.

1550279,male,17,Student,Sagittarius,"02,June,2004","             Yeah, so 18 hours with electricity is the best way to spend the first part of summer in Texas, right? RIGHT?? Actually, that would be a 'no'. We had a huge thunderstorm cell come straight through the Dallas area last night (while I was out seeing  Miss Saigon ) which knocked out our power until 4:00 this afternoon.  2 days of summer school down, and the class is turing out to be fairly entertaining. Our teacher makes lots of jokes and tells us stories, so it doesn't seem like we're really there for 5 hours and 15 minutes. We start giving our first speeches tomorrow, though, but hopefully this trend will hold...         "
1550279,male,17,Student,Sagittarius,"31,July,2004","             Wow..........strange (and bad) movie. I won't spoil it for any of you who actually think you want to go see it, but trust me, it's not worth the $6 or $7 dollars to get a ticket. Actually, it's the only movie this summer that I've seen which I won't be getting on DVD when it comes out as a result of me hating the movie (see my note next to  The Terminal ):    Van Helsing  Troy  Shrek 2  Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban  The Day After Tomorrow  The Terminal (Won't be getting on DVD since it's not a movie I'd watch all that often, but it was still good)  Spiderman 2  King Arthur  I, Robot  The Bourne Supremacy  Catwoman   About time to eat lunch and then I'm going back to CPL for a few hours. They better not be showing  The Village  there....          "
1550279,male,17,Student,Sagittarius,"29,July,2004","             That's kinda how yesterday felt  :)  After my friend and I got to the hotel 30 minutes later than I originally planned, we figured that registration would already be going on. It was a good guess if they had actually bothered to follow their schedule. The registration tables didn't even open up for another hour and 30 minutes, then we stood in Line #1 for about 40 minutes, got our nametage, then stood in Line #2 for about 30 minutes more. Note to CPL staff: A schedule is something you're supposed to follow, not just create and then conveniently forget.  I'm probably going back again on Saturday for at least part of the day (maybe not all, there's only so much I can actually do). Tommorow, I have  The Village  to go see, and I'll post my thoughts on that when I get home.          "
1550279,male,17,Student,Sagittarius,"28,July,2004","             I've had this DVD for over a year, but never got around to watching it until last night (well, technically early&nbsp;this morning). While it's probably not going to be a movie that I watch as often as some of my others ( Galaxyquest ,  The Mummy (Returns) , etc.), this has to have been one of the best non-action and saddest movies that I've seen in a very long time. If you haven't seen it (and you can manage to sit through something where stuff doesn't blow up every 5 seconds) definitely go out and rent it.  CPL starts today, so expect my post tomorrow to deal with my experiences that I have there.          "
1550279,male,17,Student,Sagittarius,"23,July,2004","             The numbers don't stand for quite the same things that they did the first time though. This time, it's 1 DDR Party, 2 FFXI Websites, and 3 Extremely Good Movies.   1 DDR Party:  Tuesday night Sam had a DDR party over at his house. While only a few of us actually had prior experience playing, it was fun, and a bunch of people made the comment that they wanted to go out and buy it. It did strike me as being a little humorous when people aske me if this was just a normal DVD. Not sure how you would connect the pads then...   2 FFXI Websites:  The site I am designing for my FFXI clan finally went online on its new paid hosting, and I have also been recruited as the lead person for the FFXI division of another website. Not exactly what I would call the best timing to have both of these come up together, but it'll at least keep me busy for a while.   3 Extremely Good Movies:  I saw 3 movies this week:  I, Robot ,  The Bourne Supremacy , and  Catwoman . I liked all of these movies a whole lot, and definitely recommend that anyone reading this should go see them.  I, Robot  was a very entertaining cdi-fi/mystery movie,  The Bourne Supremacy  was an extremely good sequel (although I suggest seeing  The Bourne Identity  first), and  Catwoman  rivals  Spiderman 2  as being one of the best superhero(ine) movies I've ever seen.  Going along with the number 3, that's how many people called my house within 45 minutes wanting an answer to the exact same question. Not a whole lot of cross-communication going on there...          "
1550279,male,17,Student,Sagittarius,"17,July,2004","             Yesterday marked the one month point until we have to go back to school (August 16th). Every summer I always say that I'm going to do a whole lot of stuff, but (as expected) I maybe get about 1/10 of it done. Still in the middle of reading my two books for summer reading which hopefully I can get finished up by the week prior to school starting so I have a few days to review each of them. Anyone that knows me knows that reading comprehension isn't exactly an area where I excel in. Plot summary? Yes. Characters? Kinda. Style analysis and what the deeper meaning of lines 5-23 are? No. &nbsp; For the past 4 nights (Tuesday-Friday), we've had Vacation Bible School at our church. Since my grandparents are the ministers, I of course get to help with  everything  that we do (food, singing, crafts, etc.). At least that's over with and I hold the unofficial veto power for any and all future years. &nbsp;  Ratchet and Clank  (the first one, not  Going Commando ) is my new favorite game. I'm about 2/3 to 3/4 done with it already, and next up on my list is the sequel. I'm trying to play and beat&nbsp;games that have sequels (or simply more games coming out in the series) coming out this fall ( R&amp;C: Up Your Arsenal ,  Sly 2: Band of Thieves ,  Jak 3 , etc.) before the sequels come out. Then not to mention great games such as  Beyond Good and Evil ,  Metal Arms: Glitch in the System , and  Prince of Persia  that I still need to play. I wonder if 1 month if even enough...          "
1550279,male,17,Student,Sagittarius,"15,July,2004","              Sam wanted me to make sure that I mentioned that he and Stephaine Holford were over at my house on Tuesday. Sam and I were supposed to be working on the Computer Science Club website,&nbsp; but all we really did was play DDR for about 1-2 hours. So Sam (and Stephanie), here's your 'shout out' that you wanted on my blog&nbsp; :).            "
1550279,male,17,Student,Sagittarius,"06,July,2004","             Hope that anyone who bothers to read this had a great 4th of July weekend and did lots of fun stuff. We didn't go anywhere like we normally do since tonight we are going to see the second musical that we have tickets to,  The King and I .  Since Saturday evening, I have been downloading episodes from two of my favorite comedies on Fox. The first one,  urlLink  Quintuplets  , just premiered a few weeks ago, but has already become one of the shows that I try to watch every week. The other show,  urlLink  Arrested Development  , has completed its first season and is going to start its second in the fall. Both of these shows are part of Fox's LOL Sunday lineup, so it makes them easy to watch along with  Malcolm .         "
1550279,male,17,Student,Sagittarius,"01,July,2004","             The past two days have been pretty boring for me. Next week is a completely different story, though. If you're going to read this post, however, you get a run down of the boring past two days, not the exciting future week.  Yesterday I played FFXI....lots. Almost gained an entire level (really 2, but I had so little XP left to go for the first one that I'm not counting it) by fighting in Batallia Downs. Kazham needs to go die and take all of its evil Gobs with it. Also started the first Splinter Cell on Xbox (again, I have this habit of restarting games that I'm not all that far in if I haven't played them in ages) last night, but I'm still on the first level. So much for trying to diminish my backlog of games this summer.  Today was a little more active, but not by much. I went out to lunch at Cici's Pizza and then came home and started playing SWG. Not really sure how I've done comparatively in SWG today to FFXI yesterday, but I've still made progress. I also explained to my parents about upgrading their cellphones to GSM (I'm the only one with that right now), but I still need to get them to go to Cingular and actually do the upgrade.  Yeah, that's it. Sad, huh??         "
1550279,male,17,Student,Sagittarius,"06,August,2004","             Since there were no big movies that came out today that I wanted to see (although I probably will rent  Collateral  when it comes out on DVD), the movie that made today's cut was  The Manchurian Candidate.  Well, the reviews were definitely right on this one; it was an extremely good movie and a welcome change from last week. If you've seen the original (I haven't), it supposedly changes quite a bit of stuff up (such as who is running for office, etc.). No complaints from me though, and it's definitely one of my recommended movies of the summer.          "
1550279,male,17,Student,Sagittarius,"02,August,2004","             Two words, or rather a word and a number:  Doom. 3.  Wow....yeah, that's probably the best word to describe it. Even though I don't have the most powerful computer in the world (P4 2.0, 768 RAM, GeForce 4 Ti 4600 128 MB video card), this game  still  looks incredible. And even though it's not going to scare the living daylights out of you every 3 seconds (well, it might at harder difficulty levels; I'm playing on the easiest setting and only at the very beginning of the 4th 'mission'), this is a much better source for being scared than that pathetic excuse for a movie in general called  The Village.

1916038,female,14,indUnk,Cancer,"29,July,2004","            “Mummy, Daddy, wake up! We’re going to the beach today, remember?!” Jonah shook his parents by their shoulders. Daddy stirred from his sleep and leaned over to the side table to reach for the clock.  “Jonah, it’s only 5.30 a.m, son. It’s too early,” Daddy replied groggily.  “But Daddy, I want to see the sunrise,” Jonah whined. He continued to shake his Mummy.  “Jonah? What’s wrong darling?” Mummy asked him sleepily with one eye opened.  “I want to go to the beach now Mummy. I want to catch the sunrise.” Jonah urged Mummy to wake up.  “Oh, alright then. Wait downstairs and let Mummy and Daddy change before we stroll through the beach,” Mummy replied as she pushed Daddy off the bed and signaled him to bathe. Jonah excitedly got off the bed and ran downstairs.   He had always loved the sunrise and today he had wanted to catch the sun rising across the waters. Though the drive from his house to the beach was short, he still wanted them to arrive slightly earlier. He waited as patiently as he could and got out the cereal box to eat his breakfast calmly. Just as he was about to finish, he heard his parents coming down the stairs. Like a bolt of lightning, he went to his parents and pulled them to the front door.  “Let’s go Mummy, Daddy.” He urged them.  “Jonah, we haven’t even have our breakfast,” Mummy scolded him gently.  “Nevermind Julia. We’ll have our breakfast later,” Daddy replied laughingly. So the trio went out of the door and went to their driveway. It was still dark but Jonah was used to the darkness – so were his parents. Jonah climbed on the seat quickly and rushed his parents to move faster. Seconds later, they were driving through the lane which led to the beach.   When they reached, Jonah left his parents’ side and straightaway climbed on a large rock facing the sea. He huddled himself together and felt the morning breeze blowing gently across his face. He checked his watch and realized that after all the commotion, it was only 5.45am. He turned his head when Daddy called him.  “Jonah, your mum and I will be getting our breakfast. You wait here alright? We’ll get you your breakfast too.” Nodding his head, he turned back to watch the sea. He was used to being left alone on the beach to catch sunrise while his parents went away. They had taught him to be independent though he was only eleven. He smelled the crisp air of Oklahoma and felt free. He loved the beach so much that his parents actually bought the house so that he could frequent the beach.   When a tinge of orange crept into the darkness, Jonah kept his eyes on it. Slowly, as if playing hide-and-seek, the glowing sun peeped from behind the sea. The warmth of the sun spread through the beach and pierced through the cold morning breeze, engulfing Jonah with its warmth. Jonah breathed in a fresh of fresh air and pampered himself with the feeling of being engulfed. He saw a few other people strolling together, mostly couples, hand in hand. Laying his head on his arm, he waited for his parents to come with his breakfast and they will be able to stroll the beach together.  But they never came back. Jonah waited and waited but there was no sign of them. It was his uncle who came to pick him up.  “Jonah? Come here, son,” his uncle’s voice rang out and he felt two hands taking his shoulder. He was then embraced by his uncle. He was puzzled as to why his uncle came instead of his parents and why there were tears in his uncle’s eyes. He was also bewildered as to why his uncle was hugging him tightly. What happened?   Jonah still remembered how curious he felt to see his relatives crying. Never have he seen his uncles cry though he had seen his aunties cry. His uncle Johnny led him into a room and he saw two beds occupied but the person on each bed were covered with blanket all the way over their heads. Jonah became puzzled as to why Uncle Johnny showed them to him. He was not afraid of ghost or anything. Was this another prank?   But when Uncle Johnny brought him closer to the beds, he felt his hair stand and his heart felt heavy.  “What is going on Uncle John?” Jonah asked curiously as he looked up to look at Uncle John. Uncle John only stifled a cry before lifting the covers. He felt the ground swayed when he saw his Daddy and Mummy, pale-face, lying on each bed.  “Mummy? Daddy? Wake up. Why are you sleeping?” Jonah asked furiously. He refused to believe or even think that his parents were… not coming back.  “Wake up! You promised to buy me breakfast remember?' Jonah all but shouted.  “Wake up please Mummy, Daddy. Please don’t leave me all alone,” Jonah finally cried as he hugged his parents’ lifeless body.  “Please don’t leave me all alone here. I don’t want to be alone.”               "
1916038,female,14,indUnk,Cancer,"28,July,2004","           15 years had passed since his parents died but at 26 now, he could still remember the tragedy like as if it was yesterday. His parents’ were killed at a car crashed. They crashed with a drunkard who was driving in a drunken stupor. Life had been hard after that. He still remembered asking for his parents sometimes when he had nightmares at night. But it was always his Uncle John who stood by him. It was also thanks to him that he received proper education and lifestyle. He really owned that old man a lot.   Now that he was a successful shop owner,selling books, he moved out of Uncle John’s apartment and bought one of his own. Occasionally he would visit Uncle John, like today. He needed company sometimes. He's an old bachelor.  “Uncle John? Where are you?” Jonah called out when he was at the porch.  “Jonah? Here! Backyard young man!” Uncle John shouted. Knowingly, Jonah went to the backyard and saw the dear old man standing under the redbud tree where mistletoes grew from. His Uncle John loves to plant plants.  'Atleast that will keep his mind off about getting me married,' Jonah thought to himself. Jonah hurried to Uncle John and pecked his cheek.  'Glad that oyu could come Jonah. I was getting bored being here alone. Though there is company, just next door. A new neighbour, sexy as hell, Jonah.' Uncle john smirked. Shaking his head, Jonah sat down under the tree with Uncle John.  'So how have you been ,Jonah?' Uncle John asked, getting serious. Jonah could only shrug his shoulders. He couldn't tell Uncle John that he still had nightmares. He decided that it was best to keep quiet. The two kept quiet as they gaze across the lawn. Due to the weekly companion by Jonah, he was also able to help mow the lawn.   The silence was shattered by the slam of the door. It came from the new neighbour and seconds later, a figure hurried towards them.  'John? You ok? I called your home but no one picked it up. What are ..' her words trailed off. So this is the sexy neighbour Unce John was talking about. Jonah gazed at her up and down. She was wearing long pants and long sleeve shirt but still he could&nbsp;imagine that she has got a great body underneathe.&nbsp;He was instantly attracted to her. The thought of it got him worked up. No wonder old Uncle John gets worked up easily. Poor him.  'Dana, meet Jonah, my nephew. Jonah, meet Dana.' Uncle John introduced. Jonah only offered a quick smile before dropping his gaze. In that brief moment, he could see that her eyes were a light shade of green. Her bronze hair cascaded past her shoulders and her body was petite but it curved at the right places. In short, she was beautiful. He looked up at the mistletoes before looking down at his feet again.   The man called Jonah was what she thought as rude. Not even a handshake. But she did not take it into consideration much as she has a soft spot for the man's uncle. He's so sweet.  'Well, since you're okay, I'd better go then. See you around John,' Dana said before retreating back to her home.  'What da hell was that for, Jonah? Couldn't you be more friendly?' Uncle John repriminded him. He didn't know what was wrong with him. Normally he would have be friendly with any lady that chatted up with him or he encountered but with that lady, Dana, beautiful name, his social entiquette just fail him. That lady sure has got some sort of magnetic pull in her.  'Damn Jonah. What if she never comes back after that encounter? I'll be bored to death when you're not here,' Uncle John complained exaggeratedly as he got up to go back to his house, it was getting dark.  Don't worry Uncle John. I'll make sure she comes back.'  Jonah thought. Casting another look at Dana's house, he slowly trudged back into the house.            "

3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"07,June,2004","           happy friday!  there were a lot of pretty good performances last night by pitchers, only one that i would call a great one, so we will lead off w/ that one.  here it goes: yesterdays best: z. day Mtl: 9 IP, W, 0 ER, 6 H, 0 BB, 4 K against the royals.  day has been doing well this year, despite a 5-6 record, he has an ERA of 3.12.  if he gets some more run support, either through offense or a trade, he could win 15+ a season.  he is a very good young pitcher. c. zambrano ChC: 8 IP, W, 2 ER, 5 H, 4 BB, 7 K.  he is a top 5 pitcher so far this season IMO (schmidt, r johnson, a. benitez, clemens). 7-2 with a 2.27 ERA.  his curveball has a lot more on it this year than what i have seen before.  he is able to depend on that pitch as well, and i think that he has potential to maintain this all season. c. fossum Ari: 6 IP, W, 0 ER, 5 H, 2 BB, 5 K over Bal.  his counterpart, bautista for Baltimore had a perfect game thru 5 or 6 i think, but gave up a 3 run shot the next inning. this was definitely an aberration (he got his ERA below 6), so i wouldnt look for another similar performance any time soon. c. pavano Fla: 8.2 IP, W, 1 ER, 4 H, 1 BB, 7 K.  another pitcher quietly having a good season.  while beckett and burnett are struggling, pavano has been the marlins' rock in the rotation.  2nd straight very good start (6/4 7.2 IP, W, 1 ER), and 6-2, 3.10 on season.  he might be peaking right now, so i dont know if i would hold on to him for the rest of the season. k. ishii LA: 8 IP, W, 1 ER, 6 H, 1 BB, 4 K. also having a good season (8-3, 3.36).  he is getting a bit more run support than last year, not by much, but more nonetheless.  he has shown improvement each of the last 3 yrs, especially w/ his control. c. schilling Bos: 7 IP, W, 2 ER, 6 H, 2 BB, 8 K.  always good for a solid performance, schilling has had a consistent season. for his price, you could probably get a marginally better pitcher, but he is not going to let you down very often.  if you have the money, he is a smart pickup.  those were the best performances of last night.  some pitchers to look for good things from tonight are: livan hernandez Mtl: plays at seattle tonight, who has been a struggling offensive team.  hernandez is known as an inning-eater, so i will predict 7.2 IP, 2 ER, 5 H, and a win (why not go for it all w/ my predictions?) tim hudson Oak: a safe enough pick, playing at home v. Pit, whose offense had been struggling, although they scored 7 yesterday.  i will say 7 IP, 3 ER, 7 H, and a win for tim.  i think the A's can match however many runs the pirates throw up there. al leiter NYM: has an ERA this season below 2 (1.78 i think).  playing against KC only enhances my confidence in him.  i kind of want to say CG shutout, but leiter probably doesnt have that much endurance in him.  7 IP, 1 ER, 2 H, win. brett myers Phi: plays at Min, home of the 'evil ventilation system'.  he will overcome this hardship and get a win in 6.1 innings.  he will give up 3 ER and 6 H. i know this to be a fact (not really...had you fooled there) scott schoeneweis Chisox: my 'out on a limb' pick for the night, he had a great rookie year 3ish yrs ago (along w/ rick ankiel), and has done well this season as well. performance of the night v. Atl-CG 3-hitter, 1 unearned run, 2 BB, 9 K, win.  there you have it, who says i dont have the balls to predict stuff?  hope this is helpful and accurate.  if you find any errors, you will get mentioned in my next post, and maybe you will win a new car!  any comments regarding format and or content are always welcome.  good luck, and have a good one!

3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"07,June,2004","           here is my 1st hitter update, for yesterdays games.  just one correction from yesterdays pitcher update: the mil/ana game went 17 not 15 innings.  ty to captainfurby for bringing that to my attention.  on w/ the hitter update.  enjoy!  e. renteria StL: 1-4 GS HR, 2 R, 4 BI, 1 BB.  Decent numbers on the yr, only 4 HR. 9 consecutive 1-hit games, .261 avg.  this seems to have been an anomaly.  He is probably the best SS in the NL, but the AL has much better options c. guillen Det: 3-4 HR, 2 R, 1 BI, SB.  Quietly having a very good year for the relatively speaking, rejuvenated tigers.  Batting .326 on the yr w/ 5 3B, 9 HR, 15 2B.  OBP is hovering around .400.  he strikes out a bit too much, but that has always been his case.  Easily his best yr as a pro m. tejada Bal: 2-4 HR, 3 BI, 1 R, 1 BB, 1 K.  broke out of a bit of a slump (2-14, 2 BI since 6/3) in a big way.  Has had a consistent yr for the o’s, batting .312 on the season.  He has established himself as one of the top SS in the league. b. abreu Phi: 2-4, 2 HR, 3 R, 3 BI, 1 BB, 1 K.  has had incredible last 5 games (8-18, 9 R, 7 BI, 6 BB, 3 K, 2 SB, 3 HR, 2 2B).  batting .299 w/ 14 HR on season, he has been very solid for the majority of the season.  I would pick him up now if you still can. Aaron rowand Chisox: 3-5 HR, 2B, 2 R, 3 BI, 1 K.  he has been the team’s 4th OF all season, but w/ maggs out for an expected 4-7 weeks, it is his chance to shine.  He got off to a great start yesterday.  If you are looking for a cheap player who will start, look no further. d. miller Oak: 2-4 GS HR, 4 BI, 2 R, 1 K.  on a 3-game tear (6-13, 2 HR, 12 BI-yes 12, 4 R, 4 2B).  batting .291 for the season.  He has not been especially good all year, and IMO is somewhat overpriced.  However, if he can keep this up, that will no longer be the case.  This recent tear may have some correlation to reds’ pitching however.  Wait a game or 2, this could be a fluke.  Other players that had notable games last night include: k. greene SD, t. hafner Cle, j. cruz TB, j. dye Oak (another very hot player), and a. dunn Cin (see last parenthetical statement).  There are some obscure players I have adopted as my favorites that I will update you on periodically.  Here are 2: k. youkilis Bos: mentioned profusely in Moneyball by Michael lewis (a fascinating book if youre into these things), his nickname is “the greek god of walks”.  He has had a productive rookie season, and last night was 1-3 with a walk.  Batting .286 w/ OBP of .400, look for great things next year and maybe even late this season from him so taguchi StL: 1-4 3B, 1 BB, 2 R last night.  He is also a rookie this yr, and is used primarily as a PH or PR.  Batting .258 on the season, he also has a 1.000 base stealing % (1-1).  He has shown improvement lately, and I think that he could start in a year or 2.  I follow him b/c I like his name. Its going to be the new phrase in StL soon.  People will be like “that was so taguchi”, meaning “that was so clutch”.  Mark these words, he will be big, baby!  That’s it for the hitter wrapup today.  Some games that should have good hitting numbers today are:  Col (j. Jennings) @ NYY (j. Contreras), Mil (w. obermuller) @ Ana (a. sele), and Phi (b. myers) @ ChW (s. schoeneweis).  The last one is just b/c the last 2 games in the series have been 13-11 and 14-10, not b/c of poor pitching.  Any comments you have are welcome.  Hope this is helpful.  Have a good one!          "
3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"07,June,2004","           last night saw quite a few outstanding performances by pitchers.  i will go over a few of them as well as give my thoughts on some pitching matchups today.  my family drove to my grandparents' house in virginia beach last night and today, so i will be there for the week.  the 11-hour drive wears on you a bit, but i am recovering now.  so here you are: last night: ben sheets Mil: he turned in the performance of the night and left w/ a ND.  9 innings of 1-hit scoreless ball, but the game went to 15 i believe.  no walks and 5 K as well.  he seems to have fully recovered from the dizziness that made him miss his last start pedro martinez Bos: a great outing in an inconsistent year, he got a W for 8 innings of scoreless 2-hit pitching.  walked 2 and 8 Ks as well. this is in stark contrast to last outing where he gave up 7 ER and 11 hits in 5 IP. i am of the opinion that his ship has been righted for this season (yes i am reversing field from yesterday, i can do that) zack greinke KC: got the win after 7 innings of scoreless 3-hit ball w/ 5 K and no walks. although pitching v. the expos didnt hurt his stats, he has quietly put together a solid year.  he is 1-1 in 4 starts, w/ an ERA of 1.73 over 26 innings (6.5 per start).  a good option for AL only leagues or if youre low on $.  3-1 K-BB ratio looks pretty good also. kelvim escobar Tor: if you want to talk about hot, heres your man.  last 2 outings, he has been 1-0 with 1 ER over 16 innings.  last night he got a ND after 8 innings of scoreless 4-hit ball, including 11 K. 4-2 on the season, 3.34 ERA, and 54-20 K-BB, another good AL-only pickup. he seems to be settling in as a starter after being a reliever 2 yrs ago. randy johnson Ari: big unit rebounded from an average performance last outing, notching a W on 1 run, 3 hits in 7 IP.  only 4 K, but he has been 5-0 beginning w/ the perfect game. 8-4, 2.75 on the season, and is averaging nearly 7 IP per start. other notable performances came from Roger Clemens (0 ER, 3 H, 6.2 IP, 6 BB, 7 K, W), Javier Vazquez (1 ER, 5 H, 7 IP, 0 BB, 6 K, W), Matt Clement (3 ER, 5 H, 8 IP, 1 BB, 9 K, W), as well as Jerome Williams and Ted Lilly. today's games: since i just now have gotten access to a computer, i already know what happened to mark prior today.  after a solid 1st outing, he struggled against st louis.  he went 3.2 innings and gave up 5 ER on 5 hits and 5 BB.  he struck out 1.  he threw 83 pitches, 49 for strikes.  edgar renteria hit a GS in the 4th to knock him out.  as i said yesterday, i would give him another start or 2 to make sure he has recovered (i have to emphasize it when i get something right). other pitchers to look for today would be: b. lawrence SD: although he is pitching against a solid boston lineup, the padres have given him plenty of run support.  last start was solid (1 ER, 5 H, 7.1 IP), and i would look for a performance slightly below that today (this is definitely a limb i am going out on, but he doesnt usually walk many) k. brown NYY: he has been concerned w/ hes control lately, but his walk numbers are very low (17 BB in 78.2 IP). his last start was mediocre, but he is 7-1 on the season.  i would look for another 7 IP, 3 ER and a win from him. j. schmidt SF: after 2 opening losses, 7-0 with a 1-hitter.  last 2 starts have been 2-0 with 14 IP, 3 ER, 7 H, 20 K, and 5 BB.  pitching at TB shouldnt bring him any problems. this is as close to a lock as you can get, i would think. e. milton Phi: another relative unknown i am fond of.  7-1, 3.78 season. last 2 starts, he is 2-0 w/ 14 IP, 2 ER, 8 H, 8 K, and 5 BB.  the white sox offense has been solid this yr, but maggs is out, so milton should have a good start and i believe he should get a W.  that is your wednesday pitcher update. tomorrow we will cover hitters.  feel free to post any feedback whatsoever.  i hope you can find this helpful and enjoyable. have a good one!            "
3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"07,June,2004","           this post is my take on who is 'hot' and who is 'cooling off', based on performance over the last week or so.  in the fantasy game i play, players' prices fluctuate pretty closely with their performance, however, some do not (eg Roger Clemens' plummeting (sp?) price).  this is therefore not a barometer of who will make more $, just who has been playing above or below what they have done this season.  that said, here are my picks and their stats last week:  HOT: hitters:  J. Estrada C Atlanta: 8/17, 4 runs, 4 RBI, 4 2B, 1 HR, 4 BB, 2K   injured lineup not hurting Estrada, he has had a career  season  S. Casey 1B Cincinnati: 6/22, 4 runs, 3 RBI, 1 2B, 2 HR, 3K   NL avg. leader on a roll along with his team  JD Drew OF Atlanta: 7/17, 8 runs, 5 RBI, 2 HR, 6 BB, 2 K, 1 SB   injury-free season shows how good he can really be  K. Griffey OF Cincinnati: 8/19, 8 runs, 5 RBI, 4 HR, 6 BB, 3 K   see JD Drew  J. Dye OF Oakland: 7/25, 6 runs, 6 RBI 3 HR, 3 BB, 7 K, 1 SB   trying to prove that hot hot start was no fluke pitchers:  C. Carpenter SP StL: 6/2 7 IP, W, 9 K, 7 H, 3 ER                       6/7 8.1 IP, W, 6 K, 9 H, 3ER   7-1, 3.42 on the season, next start 6/12 at Texas. Cards have   had good run support all season.  low ERA and walk ratios; too   many hits may come back to haunt him though.  Danny Graves RP Cin: blown save 6/5 can't discount 26 saves   already.  the 3.27 ERA for a closer is a bit frightening.   he has 3 games v. Cle this week, and should be good for a save   or 2 in that series  E. Milton SP Phi: 5/30 7 IP, W, 8 K, 3 BB, 1 ER, 3 H                    6/4 7 IP, W, 5 K, 2 BB, 1 ER, 5 H   7-1, 3.78 season, next start 6/9 at ChiSox. only drawback is   that he only averages about 5.2 IP per start.  good control.  M. Prior SP ChC: 6/4 6 IP, ND, 8 K, 2 H, 0 ER   1st game back from rehab was stellar, wait until 6/9 start v.   StL to see if hes back for good.  F. Cordero RP Tex: 2-0, 18 S, 1.90 on season.  has 2 games v. Pit   coming up, then 3 v. StL.  he is ready for a breakthrough IMO.  A. Benitez RP Fla: 1-0, 22 S, .56 season.  has been the best RP   in baseball this season.  very consistent, gives up very few   walks and ER.  should be good for 50+ saves this year.  COOLING OFF: hitters:  Pittsburgh in general- 2-8 last 10 games, Mackowiak, Ward, and   Jack Wilson went a combined 15/81 last week, and 3 games v. Oak   this week don't look promising either.  P. Burrell Phi: 43 RBI on the season, only 1 in the last week as   he went 3/20 with 1 run and 5 K.  L. Overbay 1B Mil: avg is OK (6/16) but earlier power numbers are   way down (1 RBI, 0 HR last week).  3 games each v. Ana and Hou   w/ their pitching is not promising.  V. Guerrero OF Ana: 3 games does not make a slump, but beware.   after his 9 RBI game, he has gone 0-12 w/ 3 K in last 3 games. i   would still hold on to him for now, but keep an eye out. 3   games v. Mil should help.  J. Pierre OF Fla: now has 10 CS on the yr, 3 last wk.  avg. has   also dipped about 15 pts last wk.  moved to 2nd in order has not   helped him produce so far. pitchers:  J. Kennedy SP Col: 4-3 3.64 season, last game only 3 IP before   knocked out.  the hot start is over.  dump him while you can.   next start is 6/9 v. NYY at Coors.  P. Martinez SP Bos: 6/2 ND, 5 IP, 4 K, 2 BB, 11 H, 7 ER   lucky not to get a loss last game.  has been very inconsistent   all year.  maybe if he got a deal signed...  injured pitchers:    J. Beckett Fla: 15 day, 5/31, blister   R. Halladay Tor: 15 day 6/4 (retroactive 5/28) shoulder   J. Peavy SD: 15 day 5/27 (r.a. 5/20) forearm sleeper:  Kevin Youkilis 3B Bos: the star of Moneyball by Michael Lewis is   having a consistent rookie season.  over the last week, he is   4/20 w/ 2 runs, 4 RBI, 1 2B, 1 HR, 2 BB, 4 K.  i wouldn't take   him now unless i was nearly out of money, but i will update you    on him periodically.  this ends the first weekly wrap-up.  please comment on anything you disagree with or feel i omitted.  also feel free to comment on the general feedback.  as few people are reading this right now, you have a chance to shape this site significantly for the future.  also, since few people read this, i have no choice but to listen to you, so send whatever you want and tell everybody you know about this.  hope you enjoy and find this helpful. p.s. i took the joke thing off, so you can no longer be offended.

3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"13,July,2004","           (actually from 7.11.04) yes this is edition 2 of the weekly top 5. this is a big step towards consistency, as i have not yet forgotten about this. about 2 more of these and i would think that this will have been solidified as a definite 'department' of the blog. without much further ado, this weeks top 5 is: 'things i heard the most at camp'  5) 'hows it going, hoppy?' according to camp lore, hoppy is some guy from 100 years ago who was made fun of bc he had a curved spine and a short leg. to make a long story short, he was found dead in a cave, frozen to death while clutching a fawn to keep it warm. since i was kind of hopping around (w/ crutches) this nickname was bestowed upon me, and it spread quite quickly. it could be worse i guess.  4) 'hows the ankle?' pretty self-explanatory...as you hear this question more and more, you kind of get a default answer without many details once you realize that they dont want to know that badly.  3) 'i have to pee' to be expected w/ 3rd grade guys. we had a buddy system, which grew much more relaxed as the week progressed. my response went from 'get your buddy' to 'just go in the woods or something'. peeing in the woods is part of the camp experience, right?  2) 'my (insert authority figure, usually male, such as dad/grandpa) can (insert impressive feat that is usually doubled in exaggeration)' as covered yesterday, these kids still idolize their parents/whoever else. some of these stories were obviously fabricated, some were probably true. another fun thing that came up a lot about parents was personal information such as diets/weight/age of parents. these parents might want to rethink telling the kids this stuff...  1) 'what did you do to your ankle?/how did you manage THAT?' imagine telling about 100 people (literally) that your injury was from something as dumb as jumping off of a slide from 1 foot off the ground. i would have liked my injury to have been from something a bit more respectable, maybe i dived into the pool to save a kid from drowning or something like that. humility is a good thing...  there you have it. i am off to watch some us olympic trials for track & field now, then a 2-hour special on trading spaces! (yes i am quite serious, i happen to enjoy that show, and no, this does not mean i am gay) some of the designers on the other hand...          "
3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"13,July,2004","           (actually from 7.4.04) i have just had a revolutionary concept...every sunday i will give you my opinion on my personal top 5 somethings. this is very tentative, and it is more than possible that this will be the only one. with that in mind, the first category is...music albums! these are all from the last 7 or so years, so there was never really consideration for any classic albums. as you can see, most of these albums are from my favorite bands, which is no coincidence. without further ado, here are my top 5...  5. a rush of blood to the head- coldplay i got this cd last year, and i listened to it on my way to every golf match...its very calming, and i love every track from 1-7. 4. just be- tiesto this is that new (to me at least) trance album i have been raving about. the best song on it is by far the 1st track (forever today), which is probably in the top 5 songs (hint hint) for me. who says the london club scene is weak? i think he is the #1 dj in the world...heady stuff. 3. e-majn- cloud2ground another incredible techno/trance album. this is what got me addicted to the trance/indie thing. the best 2 tracks are #1 (raindown) and #6 (face2face)- which is the most beautiful song i have heard (other than amazing grace on bagpipes and possibly lee greenwoods 'God bless the usa') anyway, its an awesome album, except i dont really like the last 2 tracks. the 1st 7 are incredible 2. the anatomy of the tongue in cheek- relient k this is the most diverse album up here. they always have a couple of goofy songs on their album, the difference here is that those songs are really sweet (im lion-o, may the horse be with you). i also love the raw emotion in these words are not enough and for moments when i feel faint, and down in flames and failure to excommunicate are awesome as well. the fact that this is not their most recent album yet it makes up about half their concert set says something about the strength of this album. 1. ok computer- radiohead how do i love thee...let me count the ways...about 9, as in 9 of the best songs ever (actually track 7 doesnt really count, but its funny anyway). 3-5 kind of suck, but it seems that every compilation cd i make has at least 3 songs from this album. the guitar solo in paranoid android is one of the best of the post-hendrix era imo, and electioneering is still my favorite songs even though it is about 7 years old. karma police, airbag, and climb up the walls (the song that made me get...actually burn...this cd in the 1st place). kid a and their newest one arent as good as this, but radiohead is still a remarkable band.  there you have it...edition 1 of my top 5. if anyone has differing opinions (there should be no differing with this list) feel more than free to post a comment, i would love to hear from you (yes, you).          "
3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"01,August,2004","           this weeks edition (on time might i add) is inspired by last weeks espn/usa today coaches poll for college football.  it is: top 5 most overrated teams not named ohio state in the top 25.  5. clemson (16)-a 'hot pick' bc of a qb and a win over fsu last yr...and a coachs last name (bowden).  very difficult schedule, and i dont think they are very good on d either way.  projection: 7-5, outside top 25 (on record projections, im not sure exactly how many games each team will play, which could make some records impossible.  im just lazy i guess).  4. k state (13)-without roberson, teams can stack the box easily and at least slow sproles down.  not a very tough schedule, they might end up top 10, but i still wont think theyre that good.  projection: 10-3, #13  3. miami (5)-sorry to knock on them so much here...not really.  they lost a lot of talent, and they play a real schedule this yr.  projection: 10-3, #11  2. virginia (19)-overrated last yr, only difference is that they lost a qb (schaub) hmm...sounds like a top 25 team...only thing they have is solid lb play.  projection: 7-5, outside top 25  1. auburn (18)-remember last years 'sleeper' team?  the one that slept pretty soundly offensively vs. usc in opener (23-0 i believe)?  they came on in the middle of the season, but i dont think theyre anything special.  projection: 8-5, outside top 25  i could obviously be completely wrong on all of these, its mainly just my gut...at least i had the balls to pick them.  we shall see what happens.  i cannot wait for college football season!!!!!

3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"01,August,2004","           just got back from driving my neighbor back from the airport (i run a taxi company in my spare time...).  there was a bad accident on 270 east just west of 71.  there was a semi overturned on the side, and there was a pickup w/ a boat on back in the road w/ its front end completely smashed.  they had to block off 2 or 3 lanes of 270 which just left 3 open.  it was pretty congested.  i think i cut about 5 or 6 people off to get through all of the traffic, but i had to get to the airport in time (i ended up having about 15 minutes to spare).  so im kind of wondering if everybody involved is ok or not.  there were a bunch of cops plus a crane there, but i didnt see an ambulance, which either means it had already come or nobody was hurt.  i can probably update you on this tomorrow.  it was kind of sobering to see after i was getting very frustrated with traffic before i knew what happened.  i guess tomorrow is never guaranteed.  now im getting philosophical here...there now im over it :) .  im going to go watch last comic standing now.  that show is kind of dumb, but i am somewhat addicted (what else are you going to do on a tuesday night other than sit at home and watch tv?...rhetorical question alert).  peace out my children         "
3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"01,August,2004","           i just got finished cleaning my bathroom!  it was the first time i ever did the whole thing by myself.  i scrubbed the toilet and bathtub, and the counter, and then i mopped the floor.  now i am kind of sticky.  nonetheless i am quite proud of myself.  today i decided to stay home to do stuff around the house.  i am being forced to make a filing system for the whole college application thing, so i spent a couple of hours this morning setting that up.  after that i cut the grass, which is when i found out that it is really quite a nice day out.  this afternoon i will probably go play with my neighbors cat (as a job, not just because i have nothing better to do) then go hit balls at the range. another exciting thing today...i got my sat II subject test scores back in the mail.  i got 800 on math IIC, 740 chemistry and 740 writing.  i was quite shocked, especially about the chemistry which i thought i got about 550 on, and especially since i was almost dead the day i took it (sick, i slept the entire day after i got back.  very very sick, not to mention miserable.  my theory is that in every test room there is a sick kid who is sniffling and coughing constantly.  i just happened to be that person that day.)  the thing that surprised me is that the 800 (perfect score) is only the 90 percentile, which means 10% of the people get a perfect.  i guess its not that incredibly hard or something.  anyway, i am just excited about that whole thing.  :))))))  (not sure how to make excited smiley, he is smiling a lot though, as you can see. hopefully its good enough)         "
3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"01,August,2004","           yes, this means that i am back home again.  actually we got back saturday night, but i have been pretty busy.  the trip was awesome.  the only other times i have been to chicago (twice) were just connector flights through o'hare, so this was the first time i had seen the city.  we stayed downtown, so we walked around the lake shore park area, which was beautiful.  unfortunately, the traffic was terrible (worse than nyc, imo, i have heard that la traffic is worse...i really pity them if it is), so everything like the museums and shedd aquarium was closed.  the next day (friday) we went to visit campus.  i loved u chicago.  it just felt like they had the same sort of priorities that i would want (they also seemed proud that theyre the only school undefeated vs. notre dame in football...yeah, 1-0 or something).  the campus was beautiful too.  i think it is probably in my top 3 schools now (yale, william and mary), plus its a little easier to get into.  i was surprised at how seriously chicago took its baseball.  the city series (cubs/sox) was starting up the day we left, so that probably contributed, but the obsession was nearing the ohio state football level in columbus (an inascertainable level, the benchmark of all irrational obsessions i would say...although not a bad one by any means).  i think i could live in a city like that. after the visit, we drove to st louis friday night.  our hotel room was upgraded to a vip suite...we were the 'customer of the day'...not sure what that is all about, but the room was cool.  we ate at j bucks in clayton (suburb), where i realized that st louis was probably as into sports as chicago.  i guess that there isnt much else in the midwest that we are so narrow-minded.  anyway, saturday morning we visited wustl, which i liked, not as much as uc, but it seemed to be a place i wouldnt mind going to.  i think i will apply there too. we got back saturday night so i would have time to go to a meeting sunday morning for camp counselors for a camp i am helping with at my church.  i get to be with 3rd grade boys for a week (july 6-10 i think).  it will be interesting to say the least.  i am looking forward to it. this morning i had my first tournament of the yr.  i was gang-raped by mosquitoes early on, so i am trying to move as little as possible now.  i overcame them to an extent, and i ended up shooting 89.  while that sounds terrible, i actually played very well, i just had 3 bad holes (2 triple-bogeys and a quad).  if you take those away it was a decent round, plus the course was tough and i hadnt played it before.  i tied for 2nd in the tournament (that should give you an idea of how 'strong' the league is-86 won it).  the group i played in was pretty bad.  on one whole we lost 8 balls (as a foursome).  the other kids kept having to go back and re-hit from the tee.  i just sat on the ground and waited, then i started cracking up...kind of like the judges on american idol during auditions.  i felt mean, but i couldnt help it.  the kids behind us were getting pretty mad, which was probably the funniest part.  they hit into us a couple of times...you have to find humor in these things i guess.  there were scores of 12 and 10 on that hole (and they both kind of cheated, but i felt bad for them).  in case youre wondering, i lost a ball but still made bogey-6 (it would have been a birdie if i hadnt lost a ball) so ha. i believe i am going to go see spiderman 2 wednesday night.  brad picked up a bunch of tickets, so hopefully everyone will be early so i dont have to sit in the aisle again (see dodgeball post).  i should probably rent the 1st spiderman since i still havent seen it.  i think thats all i have to say...this is a pretty long post, congrats if you made it all the way here:) the end.

3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"01,August,2004","           i am not going to be posting on this for a couple of days, as i am going on a couple of college visits with the parents.  we are driving (grr) to chicago tomorrow and visiting u chicago, then to st louis to visit washington u in stl.  i am looking forward to both, even though i have been bombarded with mail from wustl (i dont care about a postcard with alumni giving rates or percentage of graduates getting into medical school 4 times a week).  somebody needs to tell them this.  it actually decreases my interest. i caddied for the first time this year.  got a double bag at 12:40, just in time for the sun to be baking on me the entire day (who would want to caddy when its not 90 degrees with no clouds or wind).  this would have been a perfect day to golf.  complaining aside, i made 130, so it was more than worth it.  my shoulder might differ with me on that.  i couldnt hold the steering wheel driving back home after the loop bc my shoulder was so weak (unlike the rest of my body...) on a side note, i saw the 'soup nazi' episode on tbs tonight.  all of my friends have told me about it and quoted it, so i was expecting a lot.  it was nothing special though.  i guess my hopes were too high.  i thought the gay thugs that stole elaines armoire from kramer were funnier.  that has to be the most brilliant show EVER. yes, EVER. anyway, i have an early departure time tomorrow, so i should get to bed soon.  i should be back by sunday.

3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"01,August,2004","           another quiz i found on a blog that i coveted and therefore stole from a certain someone (if you are reading this, sorry, its being put to good use, i love your blog).  this may seem like im obsessed with golf. im not, but its a big part of my life, esp in the summer, so i mention it a lot.  anyway, here we go:  1. what is the geekiest part of your music collection?

3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"01,August,2004","           its been a while (2 whole days) since the last post, so this might be a bit long, we shall see.  yesterday, i played 27 holes of golf.  i sucked up the first 9, but then i came back w/ a 39 on the back, so i went an extra 9 holes to try to break 80 (an elusive goal that has consumed my golfing life since i broke 90).  i started off fine, but i had 2 straight 3-putts and a lost ball, which killed me, so i ended up with 39-44 83, which is my best for this season as of yet.  i was happy enough, but i know i blew it.  that just gives me something to push for this summer i guess. last night i saw dodgeball with a bunch of friends.  i got there late, so we had to sit in the aisle.  then some usher kicked us out bc it was a 'fire hazard'.  we got back in, but we had to split up.  i ended up next to some guy in the 2nd row.  there were some interesting parts, i will say that (the pizza thing, ick), but it was funny for the most part.  it could have been better, but it fulfilled its purpose of mindless entertainment imo.  we went out for sushi after that.  i dont really like sushi, but it was fun. this morning i played golf w/ my dad, my pastor, and another guy from church.  they wouldnt play for money (6-6-6 $5 nassau), which is unfortunate bc i won every 6 w/ my partner (we played for 'bragging rights', which last time i checked wont help pay for tuition).  nobody, including myself, played particularly well, but we had a good time.  after that, i went to gregs grad party at 'the barn' in westerville.  its a pretty cool place, i wouldnt mind having mine there. so there is my activity list of the last couple days.  after the party i sat at home and watched the us open.  did anybody else see the 7 green?  i have only played 1 green like that, and it is completely unfair (i 5-putted it in a tournament, it kept rolling backwards 20+ feet).  that shouldnt happen in a professional tournament.  however, everyone played the same unfair green, so in a roundabout way it was fairish.  i am pulling for phil, but i dont have anything against anybody near the top.  it should be fun to watch.

3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"01,August,2004","           last night i went to bed around midnight but didnt end up sleeping until 4:20.&nbsp; so i got some thinking done.&nbsp; i was looking around my room for paper, and i came across a notebook that i wrote in last time this happened.&nbsp; i enjoyed reading it, so i decided to post them.&nbsp; keep in mind that i had just finished reading a 1000 page book about the last 500 years of society and civilization and how we are at the end of an age (called 'from dawn to decadence' by jacques barzun, very slow read, but fascinating), so these might reflect on that.&nbsp; its basically just observations. machiavelli's 'might makes right' (this might have actually been nietzche, not sure) makes truth arbitrary. as long as God is the standard of truth, i see no problem with this.&nbsp; although truth is within God, i see no problem with saying God defines truth by defining Himself. &nbsp; tradition is undervalued in society.&nbsp; people want only to preserve themselves, not themselves in relationship to others, which is what tradition is. &nbsp; spending a half-hour a day smiling when you dont feel like it will do you more good than all the money in the world. (not sure about that one) &nbsp; if people say that shorthand caused the death of penmanship, i would argue that it creates a written language all its own. &nbsp; neatness is not necessarily having an appearance of utter cleanliness, but more a knowledge as to the whereabouts of any involved object at any given time. &nbsp; randomness is never really random at all, at least pertaining to humans.&nbsp; rather it is spawned from a desire to be separate from the expected, and, more importantly, an all-encompassing view of the expected. &nbsp; an understanding of the entire self is impossible.&nbsp; when you search for&nbsp;a cretain facet of yourself, you rarely find it, but instead learn many unexpected things. &nbsp; there are more, but they arent&nbsp;that interesting to me.&nbsp; im not sure how i feel about all of these now, but i thought that they were at least worth posting.

(this was obviously pre-planned, since i could have deleted that) 47. most people dont get my sense of humor until they know me for about 3 months 48. it is very dry and fairly sarcastic 49. i like it, but the drawback is that people never believe you when youre actually serious 50. i wish that i could vote this year 51. i missed out by less than 2 months 52. this means i wont be able to vote for a president until i am 21. 53. i guess 1 vote probably doesnt matter 54. that is just a fact, not some unpatriotic statement deserving of execution on a basis of treason 55. my number 1 pet peeve is apostrophe misuse 56. this is ironic as i never use apostrophes on this blog 57. i guess it is the ignorance as related to the misuse, like putting an apostrophe in 'visit one of our store's' (actually seen at sportmart at sawmill) 58. another annoyance is people finishing my sentences constantly 59. the people that do this actually do not know what i want to say 60. actually this is more or less one person that does this 61. obviously it is not less than one person 62. i like to find humor in little things and ironies 63. i often wonder why gangsta rap has any appeal to suburban white kids, but it does 64. my friend went to maine, and apparently most of the teenagers there are kind of like b-rad in malibus most wanted 65. they call themselves 'maineacs' 66. i can bluff really well when it comes to whether or not i have seen something like a tv show/movie 67. all you have to do is pick up little details/scenes from previews/commercials and throw them into a conversation, and nobody will suspect that you havent seen it 68. this is what i did w/ malibus most wanted 69. it works, doesnt it? 70. my dream career would be an investment banker on wall st 71. this is not what i had in mind in kindergarten 72. back then i wanted to be a carpenter, a pga pro, and somebody who goes around in a mickey costume at disneyworld 73. i dont think any of those dreams will come to fruition 74. i am completely fine with that 75. i am glad that i was more or less oblivious to pop culture during the 80s 76. everything about that decade seems hideous 77. that is another music 'style' i dont like, i guess (80s stuff, like journey...shudder) 78. i do however like livin' on a prayer by bon jovi ('86) 79. that is it though. 80. i think that the 'best of the 80s, 90s, and today' radio stations might as well be 'best of classical, rap, and heavy metal' stations for all the similarities in the 3 genres. 81. i consider myself to be very introspective 82. i would be willing to bet that this is a common sentiment among teenagers 83. this is b/c introspection is part of 'finding your identity' which is what all teenagers have to do 84. i like to think of 'introspection' as an 'introduction to inspection' which means its the first time you have seriously thought about anything of consequence 85. there are obviously exceptions to this, but its a general rule 86. another thing that i dislike immensly is the whole feminist movement 87. i am all for equal rights/pay/etc, but the rest of the movement is such a joke. they have such a chip on their shoulders, its annoying.  the 'us v. the world' attitude is not going to win much support imo 88. they believe that they are better than men, which kind of discredits their whole position, that of gender equality 89. i just thought of that last one :) 90. i had another good one, but i forgot it 91. i always sing along with my radio when i am driving alone 92. i also sing when my friends are in the car with me 93. this seems to annoy them 94. i cannot wait to get away from ohio and go to college 95. my life here is fine, i just want to go live on my own and kind of start over 96. this is why i swear to myself that i wont go to ohio state (that plus the fact that its huge) 97. i will not however stay away from ohio stadium for the rest of my life (or the rest of columbus for that matter) 98. whenever i pass it on the freeway (315) i salute it (completely serious) 99. i can give you 100 reasons why OSU-michigan is the #1 rivalry in sports (if i remember, this will be my top 5 blog for michigan week) 100. i did this whole thing in 1 sitting! ha 101. not all of these were actually about me...youve been scammed! :)  that is it, hopefully you know a little more about me (other than 'this is an awkward subject') :) a quick golf clap for paul casey and thomas levet who share the british open lead (probably not the case by the time you read this).  believe it or not, levet was in that playoff in the open 2 yrs ago when ernie els won.  so he can play. casey might have been ryder cup for the brits, not sure on that (i dont care that much, so i wont look it up...for now) tomorrow i am helping out with the disabled kids at church.  hopefully austin is there :) unfortunately, we always play kickball or soccer over there, and i cant do that.  we can figure something out.  goodnight!

3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"01,August,2004","           i am not really in a posting mood tonight.  i am very tired, which makes me grumpy/irritable, which i have been tonight.  i did in fact get ncaa football 2005 today (a dumb purchase since i will have to get 2006 next year in preparation for college), and it is a very incredible game.  the sound is so much better, there is no comparison.  there are other new things, like actual sports illustrated covers for dynasty, plus 'greatest game' scenarios ('97 rose bowl, '03 fiesta bowl, who won both of them?  thats what i thought :)  the only dumb thing is that both of those you are supposed to beat ohio state.  the anti-buckeye sentiment pops up again (this is a theme among the buckeye faithful that will be mentioned a lot more as football season approaches...wow, less than 2 months, that just hit me (trembling with anticipation)).  the one annoying thing (this will turn into more than 1, trust me) is that the playbook changed, and i was so used to 2003, so it is a bit confusing.  also it is always kind of hard to learn a new game, so it can be frustrating.  all of this paragraph to say that i like the game very much.  if you like college football (who couldnt?) get it. i did in fact get to go chip at the driving range today.  i got a small bucket and went through it a few times until my ankle started to hurt a little, and then i left the balls there (biggest waste of $4.50 ever).  also contributing to my early departure was an old guy that was chipping from a pot bunker directly across from me.  very disconcerting.  i did however develop a new shot, a low spinner that you bank into a hill of rough just in front of the green.  this is a pretty common shot, but i have never tried it before.  i got it to become somewhat effective, just need to practice more... i had a big scare today.  my dad noticed that fluffy jr. (one of my goldfish) was belly up in my fishbowl, but when he tapped it, he came to.  he seems to be fine now (knock on wood, cross fingers, etc), but that scared me to death, and put me in a worse mood.  my fish are almost 3, which is pretty old i believe.  i know death is inevitable, but i have grown quite attached to them.  every time a pet dies, i swear i wont get another one, but i always do. speaking of the british open, i guess it starts in about 2 hrs.   urlLink here is a convenient link to the leaderboard. . i dont think i have any more post in me.  i have to go rest up so i can go do nothing tomorrow.  stupid ankle...         "
3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"01,August,2004","           not sure why i am even posting anything now, probably just out of habit i guess.  the allstar game kind of sucked, as it was never really a game.  it was cool to see the AL hit for the cycle in the 1st inning, thats about it.  since it wasnt really worth watching, i watched outback jack (speaking of not really worth watching).  it was at least better than other 'love' reality shows like the bachelor crap.  they use the hanging suspense stuff way too much though.  it doesnt work as well when its that blatantly obvious (another good example: the davinci code-of course i would say that book sold ok-i still find it insulting to my intelligence). other than my fascinating tv watching, nothing much happened today, so thats about all i have to post.  no great insights either, and most importantly: no obsessive compulsive thing i have to talk about here!  except listening to my new 'repeat' song-'light and day' by none other than the polyphonic spree.  their new album just came out (together were heavy), trust me it is incredible.  listening to a song on repeat is not obsessive compulsive (henceforth OC, i am sick of typing that)...right?  yeah... sidenote: i love whoever invented ace bandages!  the most comfortable form of support i can find, and a lot cheaper too.  that about covers it...goodnight!

(there is also a link on the sidebar). i did basically nothing today other than get my haircut.  i read about 100 pages of rebecca, which is becoming, to my horror, actually enjoyable.  i am borderline recommending it.  life is kind of boring when i cant golf, plus most of my friends are on vacation this week (this always happens, they go different places, but all at the same time...its a conspiracy).  i played ncaa football 2003 for the first time in almost a year i think.  i realized it was set on 'jv' (very easy) when i ran the opening kickoff back for a td. i think 2005 comes out this week, and i am somewhat inclined to go get it.  i should sleep on it. i think i am going to head out to the range tomorrow to chip if nothing else.  i might try a few swings if i feel up to it. thats about all i have to post for today.  i am going to go watch the allstar game in a bit (go AL! since the tigers are going to make good use of home field advantage when they make the world series...a little baseball humor there).  i might post again later tonight, just wait and see!

3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"01,August,2004","           yes this is the title of the song i was looking for last post.  once i posted i thought 'why dont i just look for myself?', and lo and behold, i found it in about 1 minute (google search for 'hp commercial' + pictures).  it is called 'pictures of you' by none other than the cure (i knew it sounded familiar).  i actually found it on some message board about commercials...did not know of such things...no further comment.  anyway, its a pretty old song, but it is very catchy...hp gets great songs for its commercials, there is another one that i like, i am not going to search for it bc there arent any words to search for, but someone in the marketing dept deserves a raise (no my dad does not work there). went to the doctor today, he confirmed that it is a severe sprain, and that the earliest i could hit balls is in about a week, which would leave me with about 2 weeks to get into peak form for the beginning of the season...i wish this wasnt going to be my senior year bc i dont want to go out on a negative.  who knows, maybe it wont be, but 2 weeks without golfing is not helpful at all.  if i had to be injured, i would almost rather it be right before season so i would have a tangible excuse for the inevitable regression of my game that will occur (sorry about the bout of verbosity, i have to warm up for school coming up fairly soon...ack).  anyway, i would like to go chip and putt at the driving range maybe starting weds or thurs, who knows.  this is really making my summer more difficult than what i had planned.  my game seemed to be coming around, too...yes, i am quite despondent here.  its just that i have done the exact same thing every summer since after 8th grade (golf/caddy more or less every day and get about 100 rounds in each yr), and i really enjoyed that whole routine, especially now that i can drive.  now i have to otherwise entertain myself, and the only big positive is that i can sleep in.  i really hope that some higher purpose for this incident manifests itself soon, bc i am kind of annoyed about my situation. tomorrow i go to get my pre-senior pictures haircut.  thankfully i got my mom to schedule it about 2 weeks (a common time period for this post) before pics, bc i absolutely hate how i look for about a week after my haircut.  i guess that is pretty common actually.  speaking of senior pics, i have to go get a suit soon...i am plugging for armani! (what do you mean, $400 could be better spent on college?...) in addition to finding that song by the cure, another band i stumbled upon today (w/ a new release) was the polyphonic spree.  its kind of a rock group with a 20ish person choir.  very unique sound.  i had heard one song 'light and day' before, but i didnt know who it was.  i absolutely love them... urlLink check them out, you can listen to most of their songs on their website . i read a good chunk of 'rebecca' today (summer reading requirement) and it has gotten more interesting than the beginning.  its obviously written by a woman (not meant as degradation, i just noticed quite a few details/sentiments/other fantasies that no man i know would think of let alone write.  i will let you know how it progresses. one more thing:  if anybody can tell me a word made up of the letters A G O S, i would be grateful.  i cannot come up with the word at all, i even wrote down all 24 possible combinations, and none of them seem like words to me.  i am obviously missing something, and this will bother me until i figure it out.  help?? until tomorrow...

3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"01,August,2004","           what to post, what to post?  i wont bore you with all of my ankle information like health updates/rehab endeavors/etc, as that seems to be an oft mocked activity of the older set.  i am going to go see a doctor tomorrow to see what i should be doing to help it as well as to find out when i can start golfing again (within a week, please!).  if i am able to caddy anytime soon, i would assume that it would just be single bagging, which is hardly worth it, honestly.  this would make for a very down year financially for me.  i think i need to get a job with set hours instead of spending 3 hrs a day wishing i could do something to get paid.  on the other hand, $120 for 4.5 hrs work is very good money for a 17-year old.  on the first hand, i can only caddy about 3 months out of the year...quite the dilemma.  i will get back to you on this as soon as i get back to myself first. as i watched the trading spaces special tonight (quite interesting, especially finding out frank is married...to a woman) i found myself wondering what happened to vern.  he was my favorite designer on the show, but they didnt profile him, and i havent seen him on any new shows in quite a while.  does anybody know if he quit or left or anything?  that would disappoint me quite a bit. another thing that was brought to my attention at camp had to do with movies.  an 8-year old kid spent half the camp talking to me about dodgeball and all the disgusting stuff like the pizza and the pump thing that ben stiller used (in addition to michael jacksons escapades).  i asked him when he saw it, and he said he went to it with his dad.  honestly people, there is a reason these movies have ratings on them!  an 8-year old should not be seeing this stuff and getting their minds screwed up by this (although its completely fine for a 17-year old...hmm, this will probably be my 'lying in bed, cant get to sleep thought of the night' as i turn it over in my mind, which is something i do a lot).  anyway, i just wonder why some people dont take this stuff into consideration when they are shocked that little 15-year old junior gets an std or something.  they are getting this stuff fed to them from early childhood.  just a preachy opinion of mine to mull over if you wish.  actually, i havent fully considered this topic, so i am still open to changing my stance. one more thing:  a couple of months ago, there was a commercial for hp where there were kind of action photos and then photos were added to parts of them but they still fit (not much of a description, i know).  anyway, there was a song that had something to do with pictures, something like 'the picture was all that i knew', along those lines.  that was an awesome song, but i cant find it, and i want to get that song or cd.  if anybody knows what it was, please please tell me.  i will be forever indebted to you as well, so you will have got that going for you.  i am off to do more therapy...ever try writing the alphabet in capital letters with your big toe 10 times a day?  i hope not, bc it definitely sucks.  goodnight!

3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"01,August,2004","           yes this is edition 2 of the weekly top 5.  this is a big step towards consistency, as i have not yet forgotten about this.  about 2 more of these and i would think that this will have been solidified as a definite 'department' of the blog.  without much further ado, this weeks top 5 is: 'things i heard the most at camp'  5) 'hows it going, hoppy?'    according to camp lore, hoppy is some guy from 100 years ago who was made fun of bc he had a curved spine and a short leg.  to make a long story short, he was found dead in a cave, frozen to death while clutching a fawn to keep it warm.  since i was kind of hopping around (w/ crutches) this nickname was bestowed upon me, and it spread quite quickly.  it could be worse i guess.  4) 'hows the ankle?'    pretty self-explanatory...as you hear this question more and more, you kind of get a default answer without many details once you realize that they dont want to know that badly.  3) 'i have to pee'    to be expected w/ 3rd grade guys.  we had a buddy system, which grew much more relaxed as the week progressed.  my response went from 'get your buddy' to 'just go in the woods or something'.  peeing in the woods is part of the camp experience, right?  2) 'my (insert authority figure, usually male, such as dad/grandpa) can (insert impressive feat that is usually doubled in exaggeration)'    as covered yesterday, these kids still idolize their parents/whoever else.  some of these stories were obviously fabricated, some were probably true.  another fun thing that came up a lot about parents was personal information such as diets/weight/age of parents.  these parents might want to rethink telling the kids this stuff... 1) 'what did you do to your ankle?/how did you manage THAT?'    imagine telling about 100 people (literally) that your injury was from something as dumb as jumping off of a slide from 1 foot off the ground.  i would have liked my injury to have been from something a bit more respectable, maybe i dived into the pool to save a kid from drowning or something like that.  humility is a good thing...  there you have it.  i am off to watch some us olympic trials for track & field now, then a 2-hour special on trading spaces!  (yes i am quite serious, i happen to enjoy that show, and no, this does not mean i am gay)  some of the designers on the other hand...         "
3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"01,August,2004","           yes, i am now back from my counseloring?  experience at summer camp, and it was good for the most part.  however, it was a lot different than i had envisioned it being.  about 3 hrs into the camp i sprained my ankle (and, even though about 200 people already asked me how, i will tell you anyway...we were on a playground, and i was going down a slide with some of the kids.  it wasnt very slippery, so i got stuck at the bottom.  this was not a big problem, so i hopped off the slide from about 1 foot off the ground, but i rolled my ankle when i landed, and i heard a really loud pop.  i tried to walk it off for a few seconds, but it hurt too much, so i just flopped on the ground and had somebody get the nurse.  i tried hopping back, but it was kind of far, so i ended up piggybacking on jordan (another counselor type) to the nurses office(yes, i owe you one, shut up :) ).  anyway, i went to the ER and i got crutches and an air cast, and i felt good enough to stay (even though i couldnt put any pressure on it, i didnt want to disappoint my kids).  let me tell you, a summer camp in the woods with a bunch of hills and steps is not the place to have to use crutches.  they are fun to play with, but they suck when you need to use them.  i saw myself in a mirror for the first time since tuesday, and i have all of these bruise marks around my armpits from them.  stupid crutches...  i think my injury could have been a lot worse, especially with the pop i heard.  i thought it was a ligament, which would require surgery, and since i could not move my foot at all, it was quite possible.  personally, and you dont have to agree, but i believe that God healed me enough that i would be able to stay.  i figured that there would be a reason that it had happened to me, and it turns out that there was.  one girl was homesick, so the director had me talk to her, and she ended up staying and having a good time. other than that, camp was awesome.  i was worried that the kids wouldnt warm up to me immediately, but they loved me (always a good feeling :) ), and they listened to me for the most part.  i was planning on messing around with them and running around a lot, but i obviously couldnt very well, but that opened some doors for more personal interaction.  i taught some of them how to play euchre (kind of...they still dont get following suit...thats like the easiest concept in the game...they got the whole bauer thing).  they all helped me with my crutches and held doors and whatnot, and when i got back from ER late at night, austin (the autistic one that i was supposed to help) had put a pillow and sheet on a spare bunk as a bed for my crutches.  i was quite touched. the kids got along pretty well.  they were kind of annoyed with austin bc he made a lot of noises and so forth at night which kept them awake, but they didnt really understand him that well, which is to be expected.  if you can understand him, he is just the sweetest kid...as you can imagine with 3rd grade boys, the expulsion of gas is quite the hilarity.  one night somebody did this when we were at a campfire, and everyone started falling over themselves laughing.  then austin said 'i bet Jesus is up there laughing in heaven!'  it kind of made me wish i was a dad in a way.  there was only one other major conflict in the cabin, sort of an alpha-male thing that was never really resolved, only dissuaded, but i guess that can be expected as well.  i just cant explain how much i loved interacting with the kids and how they accepted you unconditionally and how i was kind of like their hero.  it felt really good.  i guess they are still at the age when authorities in their lives are still figures to be looked up to.  i was surprised how often they were bragging about dads/grandpas/whoever being incredible in some form.  i guarantee that in 4 or 5 years they will be complaining about how annoying/stupid they are...such is life. my body is kind of beat up (not just my ankle).  my armpits are bruised, my shoulders are sunburnt, i have a million (give or take) mosquito bites, and my back is quite itchy.  throw in 2 brief showers and no shampoo over 5 days and a bath becomes quite appealling (sp?...i am tired).  sorry, i had to complain about this...anyway, it was more than worth it though.  i made some new friends among the counselors (even though i already knew them), and they were all really nice even though my injury was a bit of an inconvenience.  so yes, i thoroughly enjoyed camp.  at the end, my counselor asked me if i would do this all over again, and i said without a doubt. the one negative now is that i am going to be kind of bored until the ankle heals somewhat, as i cant golf or caddy right now.  i had to cancel mondays tournament.  the golf season starts in about 3 weeks, so i have to get better in about a week if i want to have any chance to get in good form...this kind of sucks.  at least i can finish some summer reading.  i will probably be posting more jewels about camp over the next week or so, as this is quite the long post and i forgot a lot of the stuff i wanted to write.  i will close with another 'austin one-liner'. somebody else was making up a story or something, so he said,   'liar, liar, plants for hire!'  kids say the

3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"01,August,2004","           actually that is tomorrow.  false alarm... the tournament today went ok.  the course was pretty short (cumberland trail, not cumberland like i said last post), but it was tough.  a lot of of fairway bunkers (trust me, i would know) and the greens were annoyingly fast (i believe 12 on the stimp or so...very very fast to the casual golfer such as myself).  so i limped home to an 88, which was good enough for 4th place.  the field was a bit stronger this week, and 77 won it.  it was very hot and not cloudy AT ALL during the round (this will come into play soon). after this round i wanted to go see if i could get rid of my golfers tan (very abrupt lines just above elbows and knees, around feet, right wrist (golf glove and matching rubber band line), neck, sunglasses, and a less noticable one across the forehead from my hat) at the pool, so i went over to chads house to go to the pool at medallion.  of course it was a perfect day for tanning as the sun was nothing if not stifling and generally hot during golf.  however, during the 4 or 5 minute drive to the pool, the weather went from sprinkling to torrential downpour with sheets of rain and no visibility at 30 mph.  so we turned around and just hung out for a while.  about an hour later it was clear again...stupid ohio weather...so we got to go to the pool for a couple of hours.  thankfully i didnt see anyone i knew.  i am still going to be quite pale at camp (2-3 hrs of pool time every day...ack). not much else to say, i will not be able to post probably until saturday or sunday...aha!  i just watched william hungs video for 'we are the champions'!  good stuff...i think he has gotten a little bit better, but he kind of sucks...i feel really bad for him.  i am all for some patronizing, but people usually know when i am messing with them.  to be so naive is quite remarkable.  he sure isnt going broke though...only in america i guess.  have a wonderful week, and develop some coping methods to deal with my absence early in the week as opposed to late...sorry :)         "
3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"01,August,2004","           i have just had a revolutionary concept...every sunday i will give you my opinion on my personal top 5 somethings.  this is very tentative, and it is more than possible that this will be the only one.  with that in mind, the first category is...music albums!  these are all from the last 7 or so years, so there was never really consideration for any classic albums.  as you can see, most of these albums are from my favorite bands, which is no coincidence.  without further ado, here are my top 5...  5. a rush of blood to the head- coldplay    i got this cd last year, and i listened to it on my way to every golf match...its very calming, and i love every track from 1-7. 4. just be- tiesto    this is that new (to me at least) trance album i have been raving about.  the best song on it is by far the 1st track (forever today), which is probably in the top 5 songs (hint hint) for me.  who says the london club scene is weak?  i think he is the #1 dj in the world...heady stuff. 3. e-majn- cloud2ground    another incredible techno/trance album.  this is what got me addicted to the trance/indie thing.  the best 2 tracks are #1 (raindown) and #6 (face2face)- which is the most beautiful song i have heard (other than amazing grace on bagpipes and possibly lee greenwoods 'God bless the usa')  anyway, its an awesome album, except i dont really like the last 2 tracks.  the 1st 7 are incredible 2. the anatomy of the tongue in cheek- relient k    this is the most diverse album up here.  they always have a couple of goofy songs on their album, the difference here is that those songs are really sweet (im lion-o, may the horse be with you).  i also love the raw emotion in these words are not enough and for moments when i feel faint, and down in flames and failure to excommunicate are awesome as well.  the fact that this is not their most recent album yet it makes up about half their concert set says something about the strength of this album. 1. ok computer- radiohead    how do i love thee...let me count the ways...about 9, as in 9 of the best songs ever (actually track 7 doesnt really count, but its funny anyway).  3-5 kind of suck, but it seems that every compilation cd i make has at least 3 songs from this album.  the guitar solo in paranoid android is one of the best of the post-hendrix era imo, and electioneering is still my favorite songs even though it is about 7 years old.  karma police, airbag, and climb up the walls (the song that made me get...actually burn...this cd in the 1st place).  kid a and their newest one arent as good as this, but radiohead is still a remarkable band.  there you have it...edition 1 of my top 5.  if anyone has differing opinions (there should be no differing with this list) feel more than free to post a comment, i would love to hear from you (yes, you).

3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"01,August,2004","           228 years...thats getting up there i say.  i wonder how many more years we have in us, i mean every great nation eventually collapses.  i would think that this wont come anytime soon, but in 150 or 200 years, will we still be as dominant as we are today?  i think outsourcing is going to hurt us a lot more than most people realize.  i hope that the tax incentives (if there are any) for keeping business in the country will be increased, bc this could really get out of hand.  i think labor in india is something like 5 or 10 times cheaper than in america.  why would any businessman keep his factory in america in those circumstances?  i think the government needs to do something about this.  anyway, there is my cheery, hopeful birthday wish to america.  honestly, i love this country and there is no way i would want to live anywhere else.  darn it, i am proud to be an american! i caught the last halfish of legend of bagger vance on abc last night.  i had heard it wasnt good so i never saw it, but i actually liked it.  one quote that really hit home was 'golf is a game that cannot be won, only played'.  i think thats why i like golf so much, and also why i am sick of competitive golf (about 3 more months!)  i think that, at least for me, the competition brought into golf by tournaments and high school matches kind of defeats the purpose of golf by making the competition with other people instead of yourself.  i am surprised at how excited i am for next summers golfing just bc i know i will be able to golf without any pressure and i will be able to just have fun.  the reasons i am not leaving the team in the first place are 1) my teammates are awesome 2) we have a great shot to win states, and 3) i guess i would feel like i was quitting on myself and everyone else as well.  so i will drag myself to tryouts in about a month and see where things go from there...speaking of competitive golf, i have another tournament tomorrow...at cumberland gc.  i have no idea where that is, so i am going to go mapquest it.  enjoy grilling/fireworks/whatever tonight!

3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"01,August,2004","           sorry...i have a semi-interesting story to tell you.  wednesday i went golfing at medallion cc with chad (they bought a guest package for me...buy 2 rounds get 1 free...or something like that)  anyway, when we teed off, it was perfect weather, and i played ok.  i made about a 60-footer for double bogey on the 1st hole, and i ended up with a 42 with 2 birdies on the first 9 (rookery...tipped out baby!).  then we went on to preserve, where i was playing ok.  after 4 holes, chad pointed at the sky and said 'that sucks' (it was menacing, he wasnt just anti-sky or something...just to clarify). i said 'that wont hit us until the end of the 9.  so we played on.  on 5 tee, the lightning siren thing went off, but i was like 'just pretend you didnt hear it' (i am a negative influence).  so as we walk to the green, he gets out his umbrella, and i made fun of him for being a woman (obviously umbrellas arent for men), banter, etc.  then, a gust of wind blew it inside out, and i said 'see, God doesnt approve of transgenderedness' (it was funny, just go with me on this).  but wait, thats not all...he set the umbrella down to hit a chip, and it started to blow away.  then he started cracking up and fell on the ground, so i had to run it down.  it actually jumped over a fence and went onto a fairly busy road (sunbury rd for those columbus readers).  a couple of cars had to go on the opposite side of the road to avoid it before i could get to it.  needless to say, we went in after that.  unfortunately, we were literally as far away from the clubhouse as possible, so we enjoyed a 2ish mile walk in a torrential downpour.  this red crap kept squishing up through my shoe.  i still have no idea what it was, but chad thinks it was gum.  whatever it was, when i took my shoe off, my sock was covered in redness.  my mom thinks it was dye from the brown part of my shoe...who knows.  i honestly have never been that wet before other than when swimming.  i literally could not take my shirt off until it dried for about 20 minutes.  so there you have it.  if you didnt find this at least somewhat amusing, you might as well not read the rest of this blog as it is the quintessential example of my sense of humor (either that or i didnt tell the story very well).  that was more humor than you can shake a stick at.

3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"01,August,2004","           notice a theme with these titles?  dont worry, i wont keep doing that.  anyway, i just found out one of the most annoying things you can do (other than not tipping your caddy...cough cough).  next time you buy something cheap with cash, like mcdonalds or something, give the cashier more money than you need to.  for instance, if you get 2 double cheeseburgers and a small coke (my usual order), the total is $2.97.  so i give them a $5 and two $1, which makes absolutely no sense.  they kind of stare at the money and then go 'you gave me too much', then you say 'can i have my change then?'.  it is one of the funniest things ever (if you have a somewhat malicious sense of humor as i do. (stressing the somewhat)).  i stumbled upon this by accident, but now whenever im in a bad mood or something, this helps me out.  no i am not a complete jerk, and if you feel like condemning me (all of you people who read this), let (s)he who is without sin cast the first stone...something like that.  i honestly dont think this would offend anyone though.  now that i have made this post unfunny with my political correctness that i cant stand in other people, i shall leave.

3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"01,August,2004","            i have found the secret to shooting much lower scores in golf:  play the womens tees!  dont laugh...today i tipped it out on the front 9.  i hit the ball pretty well, but my wedges were going everywhere except where they were supposed to.  so i said, if i play the womens tees on the back 9, i will have a wedge into every green (at least par 4s).  so i sucked up my pride and did that.  i spent the majority of the time trying to think up tough comebacks for people who might make fun of me.  unfortunately nobody did.  actually that was probably fortunate as i couldnt think of anything other than explaining all of this, which would take way too long.  anyway, i was bogey-free on the back, and i shot a 1 under 35.  i hit a par 5 in 2 with a couple of 5-woods (3-putt par...ack!), and i had some sort of wedge into every other hole (except 11, a par 3 that i hit 9 iron on).  i figured that if people laughed at me they werent secure in their manliness, unlike me.  yeah..."

"
3568056,male,17,Sports-Recreation,Capricorn,"01,August,2004","           yes, it has been awhile since i posted, as i was occupied with actually doing things with people and escorting ryan (my friend, who as he puts it, is from florida but happens to live in kentucky) around town...there might be something to this social stuff...i will attempt to make up for this with renewed vigor, or not.  i definitely wont use that phrase for awhile again. i dont think that he had changed that much, which was a huge worry i had.  i really felt sick when i was waiting for him to come.  i think he has changed somewhat, which is obviously natural, and i have also changed, even though i dont really perceive it.  so we got along pretty well, not as naturally as in elementary school or anything.  it was more like somebody from church i see 2 or 3 times a month, chemistry wise.  the thing that disappointed me was that pretty much none of his friends from 'back in the day' were available.  they were all on vacation, either that or they had some vague 'plans'...no comment.  so we ended up seeing a movie friday and saturday nights, and just hanging out.  we saw bourne supremacy friday with philip, dan, and andrew.  then ryan wanted to go to walmart for no real reason.  i dont know where any are (although i know there are some), so we settled for meijer.  he showed me how to do a 720 in a shopping cart.  i was kind of thinking 'you lived 5 minutes from the beach in florida, and this is what you did?'.  on saturday, we drove around for a couple of hours (literally) looking for his old house, which we eventually found.  then we played tennis and saw manchurian candidate with cody.  very confusing movie, but im almost positive i had seen it before, and no, it wasnt the original version...ha, it came to me...i saw a preview.  no im not completely stupid.  anyway...then we watched a street something or other, like a magician who didnt do much until the very end.  i didnt know they had those in ohio.  oh, but they do...then we hung around easton for awhile...i had no idea how ghetto it got.  i kept making stupid comments, like 'oh, theres ray allen' (i do that to people wearing jerseys...cant help it), and ryan said 'one of these days, youre going to get shot'.  it would be my honor to get shot for being dumb like that, and it might just cure me.  we went to church this morning, and after lunch at panera, he left.  i think goodbyes are so much harder when its not somebody youre going to see the next day or week.  maybe we can get together again when more people are in town...theres a lot more to tell, but this is probably kind of boring and long already. i did get a few new cds:  just be-tiesto; this is trance, vol 2-various; and ocean avenue-yellowcard.  all 3 are incredible.  the various one is like 80 minutes of continuous dance/trance mix.  i love it dearly, so much so that it will replace a rush of blood to the head (coldplay) as my new 'pre-golf' cd.  i may go over requirements for this later...ironically, one of the songs is a mix of clocks by coldplay.  i guess this genre is not for everybody, im not sure how thats possible not to like, but ryan could only take about 20 minutes of it, as it was 'driving him crazy'.  the brilliance would be lost on someone who listens to country music...ick.  anyway, i like other music too, so im not incredibly strange (at least as far as music is concerned).  but honestly, i dont see how one cant appreciate this music.  you can just immerse yourself in the driving beat and bask in the intermittent glow that is the synthesizer...(yes i am listening to that cd right now).  i picture somebody gliding through a pool and then coming up with eyes closed and smoothing their hair back in carribbean crystal blue water at dawn with a sun and sky gradually lightening during the moment of transition from night to dawn to morning to day.  but thats just me.  it makes great reading music too.  once you get into the book and the music at the same time, your reading speed is driven solely by the beats.  so when the drum and bass kicks in, i probably read double time and i still know exactly what i read.  its quite enjoyable.  of course, country people could ridicule me for not recognizing their whatnot for the masterpiece that they hold it to be...beauty is in the eye of the beholder...i hate it when i use cliches...i also hate it when i cant put accents over french words.  it defeats the purpose of using it. one other thing.  the espn/usa today coaches poll (college football) was released last week, and ohio state is #9.  i guess si said we were overrated, and candidly, i think we might be.  i mean, we lost 75% of the dline, and our punter (jts favorite play is in fact the punt), as well as qb, 3 recievers (not that the passing game was anything special).  also, aj trapasso, our only punting recruit seems to have the most legal problems this side of willie williams (ooh, how does that feel, canes fans?  oh wait there arent any real one.  ooh! im on fire!).  so i would put osu #14 or so.  bob hunter, a columbus sports columnist, wrote an article about the counterproductivity of preseason polls, and i agreed with it 100%.  so tonights top 5 will be my most overrated college football teams (no i will not put osu in there just for loyaltys sake...yes i can do that).  this post is already incredibly and annoyingly long, so i wont make it much longer.  feels good to be back!

3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"31,May,2004","             Well ok, I used to play tennis at this clay court here in Singapore. It's probably the only around, so many expatriates go there for training. I met many people there, the most memorable one was this Indian boy that kept whining 'It's just a game' when I beat him 6-0. There was this boy too, by the name of Alistair, that I used to play with quite often, because his training slot was around my time too.  His mom was such a nice lady, and he was really such a nice guy. When I stopped going to the courts, I never saw him again. Only today, 3 months after his untimely death, did I know about it. Apparently he went in his sleep, with no medical records, no problems the day before. The baffled the doctors, and they could find no reason.  My dad always repeats the same old catch phrase when someone dies so suddenly: 'frailty of life'. Honestly if he can't find something fresh to say then he should shut his trap, sometimes people feel better without the overly used 'words of wisdom'. But really this death was a real bummer. How could someone so young be taken so early with no rhyme or reason. He's about my age so I inevitably started thinking 'what if it was me?'  I really don't know whether I should feel upset or glad at his death. On one hand, this guy just left his single mother standing on the edge of depression with his death. From my very short time with him I could tell there was a lot of love between the 2 of them. When something like that happens you naturally feel a little upset, but this time the feeling's different. It's this warm, fuzzy feeling in my heart that tells me not to be upset. Well actually I don't know how to describe the feeling so I just used an old and cliched catchphrase.  Those who know me would also not know that I've been thinking about death ever since I reached a certain level of maturity. All along I had feared death, feared the pain, feared the thought of going to somewhere really, really bad. Then my thoughts matured, and philosophy came into play. I knew what I wanted from this world; nothing. I've all along wanted to die an early death of old age. All along I've wanted to live a short, meaningful life; and die a painless death. I thought death by old age was the ony way death would be painless, but this death has opened up a whole new dimension for me.   I really don't know why the thought of changing places came to me. I know if I were the one to die my family would be devastated. But they have my sisters don't they? Then again I've always been the special one. The more intelligent one. The one that has the most hope in life. That poor lady had and now has no one else. I feel so sorry for her, but what can I do? If the lord were willing, if he called out my name, I think I would really not hesitate. I think I would gladly swop his place for mine.   By saying that I'm kind of implying that I have a really bad life. That's really not true. I have a really great one, but if my death could do something so miraculously good as to bring mother and son happiness, I would gladly do it. My only wish is that that could happen without me feeling pain. I'm a sucker for pain.         "

I just wasn't thinking straight because it was my last day in a place I've been living in for the past 2 years. Anyway, for those who wants my take on my day yesterday, here it is...  Well my last day at school helped me discover a very Under the Radar player in class, Benjamin Siow. I honestly did not have him on my list of targets, and he just got 1+ marks less than me in average. Well what I can tell you is that he won't be able to go UTR anymore, of he's gonna get ready to get voted off. Essentially, I won't be the one getting him exposed, I'll let the Fairplays do the job; my dearest slaves Anjan and Jason will be all over this guy once they find him out!   I was also doing some bonding with the Fairplays, through a lame coin game. But it was really nice seeing another side of them, not having to be playing the game. I was in a really good mood until a 'Jenna Awardee' came into the game. Well, his name is Samuel, and his mouth shoots off like a donkey's ass once something remotely funny comes into conversation. Not to mention his mouth smells like a donkey's ass. Some very scientifically inclined people may like to compare his words to the speed of light, and his brain to the speed of sound.           "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"26,May,2004","             The Finale... A title that lets your thoughts run wild! After the  urlLink  American Idol  finale I'm sure quite a few of you are expecting a commentary. Sorry to those people, because I've just been so touched by the song 'I Believe', and I'm gonna right about the finale of a phase in my life, and the beginning of another.  My dear friends would know that today was my last day at a place that I've detested and cursed for 2 years; the Boarding School. As I lay on my bed, the one that always seemed so uncomfortable at night but so appealing in the day, I heard the sound of something bead like falling on the floor. I looked in between the gape of the bed and the wall, and there was this glass star, the star that I had recieved on my first week here. I felt it extremely appropriate that I got the star back at the start of a new chapter in my life.  Enoch and Ken Wei helped to carry my stuff down, and him waving as my car went off reminded me of the ending of the movie 'Big Fish', where the characters of the persons life waved him his last goodbye, without any tears, but instead with joy. It is today, as I wave goodbye to the shining star of Miss Barrino, that I've grown the '10 inches more' that mother has always wanted...         "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"26,May,2004","             Today at school was a huge mess up. Yes it was P.E. again, and I realised I could actually play Badminton... Well that wasn't really the highlight of the day, because I started to step up my little gameplan.   As I said in the earlier post, I need so badly to step up into Fairplay's shoes. Guess what people? I'm already on to it! I initiated a whole chain of jokes about Mr. Mad Devendran. I'm telling you, by the crowds that surrounded my table, I think I may be even better than I thought.  Today was also the 10th year anniversary for boarding school. Ironic really, that I announce my leaving on this day too. Anyway it seemed like a farewell party all for me. The starters were really great... Prawn salad or something like that. The clam chowder, though a far cry from my mum's standards, was far better than I expected. The rest was ok... until the horrid dessert.  Away from the food, the tiki torches outside really gave me a wierdly comforting feeling. I guess it's because there are now torches for the Survivor: OM in December. Something in the hall really didn't feel right, and it was because I was sitting next to a bunch of people that I used to be comfortable with, but I am not comfortable with anymore. I was sitting with none of my friends cause they were all serving... And I just didn't feel good. I really don't know whether it's because I'm leaving, or because I found that I had no real friends.         "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"26,May,2004","             Being in my class, as I realized today, is like playing a huge game of Survivor. I find it appropriate, that as a SurvivorFire writer, I compare a few significant classmates to a few of our most loved, most hated Survivors. For your information, I got back my exam results today, and some more emerged as Fairplays, and even more dropped like flies. The first person I’m doing is a guy named Ashok. He sits right next to me, laughing his ass off all day. Any Survivor idiot can tell he’s playing the game, distracting others by ridiculing the teachers. Before the exams, he was on my Fairplay list, one that really had the potential to do well, but was valiantly concealing it. When the results were returned, he dropped to a John (Marquesas) Award. He definitely outwitted the “sheep” of the class, because a countless many fell into his laughing pit, but in the end he was completely outwitted by none other than me… There are 2 Fairplay award recipients, namely Jason and Anjan. Both play a very good game, and end up far, as in as far as top 5 in class. Both conceal their capabilities very well, playing the “I’m a doofus, don’t worry about me role.” What I know is that they definitely go home to mug their heads off. Personally I fell into Anjan’s trap at the start of the year, I thought he was a lazy pig who would couch up and do nothing at home. However sad for him, the Nurse John from above entirely spoiled his game. I got a lot of feed about him right before the exams, and I marked him on my list as a competitor. Jason, because of my past experience with him, I knew his bloody game plan. Sitting next to Ashok and Anjan, I knew I had no choice, I had to step up my game or be eaten alive. I used to be a Kelly W, having no game plan but to win, win and win all the bloody immunities. I knew that once I lost my grip I would go, right then, right there. I slowly converted into a Neleh… I let myself be used as a pawn. I let the 2 believe that “Hey, this guy is falling into my trap” he’s no longer a threat! Even though my test marks were still maintained, they no longer looked there… They only looked at how distracted I was… All I can say is: Wrong Move! Stupid, Stupid People!!  I know I’ve still got a lot of work to do… For all I know, I’m the one being outplayed! Now that they’ve seen through my bloody plan, maybe I just need a new alliance, maybe I need to be the new and biggest FAIRPLAY!  P.S. For those interested, I got 4 A1s and 4 A2s, that makes a total of Distinctions!          "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"16,June,2004","             Ok, there's this friend in my OM team called Muthusamy. Since I have nothing to talk about today, I shall talk about him, and my Indian Physics teacher. As in Indian from India... I mean... You know what I mean...  Haha... Muthusamy is going to get the 'Diane(Survivor 3) Award.' Because that's exactly what he does, boss people around with his big fat mouth... Actually it isn't fat, but it's black. So anyway he is a guy that does all the slack jobs by opening his mouth to boss people around, and when people stand up to him, he cries. There was one particular time, when the rehearsals for OM were to be done in front of the Vice-Principal, and Diane here whined about having to go for a uniform group thingy. So naturally everyone protested and yadda, the case was brought to the teacher. In the midst of puberty tempers and very uncalled for tears, Diane revealed that what he wanted was rank and power in his uniform group. Oh my heck, how many people have an attendance like you... I mean I don't even go! We were lucky we protested and the case was brought to the teachers, because normally he would brush away protests like they were nothing, and just go on doing what he wants to do...  Actually it's pretty sad that I'm probably not going to do OM again, because I really loved the experience of staying in school till late, and all the bonding through ultimately fattening foods... Haha... Go OM!           "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"14,June,2004","             I have something called an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder when it comes to turning off the lights. My mother always gets pissed at my living in darkness, and she always says something about darkness making her depressed. As if she needs anything at all to make herself depressed... But anyway my thinking today revealed to me why I always had these vampire like instincts, living in the dark and at one point biting others.  You see I've always wanted to die, like in my previous post. Just get myself away from this horrid and cruel world. But then, after I pass from this world, where will I go? In the Bible, we will supposedly go to heaven, a place of joy. We will be there for the rest of time. Just imagine yourself feeling nothing but happiness forever. Knowing that this will never end. Looking at it like that Heaven may not be too desirable after all. And I won't even need to talk about hell.  Now for the vampire part. You see vampires will never leave this world. They just live and live and continue living on in this world. The only difference from heaven is that these vampires live in a changing world. A world with emotion other than joy. A world that is free for you to explore. A world that you know, and if you don't, will grow to know. Vampires live in a world where they are free to do whatever they want, without facing consequences. Of course there's the downside of having to take lives.  By belief, vampires are servants of Satan. If only I could be a vampire not under the control of Satan, not under the control of God. If only I could be the master of my life, my free and everlasting life...         "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"10,June,2004","             Ok... Singapore just broadcasted 'World Idol' and I'm wondering why Asians could not vote. Racist people! Anyway only the first 6 people were shown, with the last 5 due next week. So here is my commentary for this week's show.  Ok when the German guy came out I was like 'What were you thinking? With that sleeveless shirt?' He is quite a good-looking guy though, but his song choice is really bad. Up-tempo songs don't usually go well with the public's taste, and he will not have an audience large enough to win. For his limited English, I would actually say that was good enough, just not enough to win.  The Aussie Idol had a great voice, but his flamboyant style really puts me off. What's worse, he picked a well known song, changed the arrangement totally and destroyed the song. He was like talking melodiously, creepy. For the Pan Arabic Idol, who am I to judge? But anyway all I can say is that I thought her to be very brave but maybe her target audience is not huge enough to win World Idol. Right from one of the judge's mouths, funny he was reading my thoughts...  The Dutch Idol is another super geek turned superstar. And I really like his sense of humour, banking on his geekiness to give him the cool look. And this is emphasised greatly on the spectacles! He was quite good, but not outstanding, and like I said before not outstanding, means not winner. I'm still wondering however, how he got through the second auditions when he forgot his words. I don't think American Idol would have allowed him to.  A law student with a big face. Sy whatever you want but his voice is really good. His performance however really pitchy. I don't know if he uses English frequently, but anyway not good enough to win. But anyway I don't think anyone was paying attention to his pitch problems because of his good looks.   The Polish Idol... Ok, first things first, BRACES? Oh my god, Simon is never going to use the phrase 'Too young for the competition' anymore. Well obviously she had a lot of pitch problems and an awkward sense of volume control, but like the German judge said, she has a big voice, and an even bigger personality. I love the personality and the dialogue between her and a few of the judges. I especially like the one where one of the judges said something about her being as bad as the Polish judge, and she had a look of pure horror on her face as she answered 'No, not him!'   Hahaha... That's all for today, I'll bring you more next week!         "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"09,June,2004","             Yep, I was playing 'The Sims: Superstar' yesterday, and I killed 2 people! Well I'm getting a little wierd, using the example of making a 70 year old couple give birth to 4 kids to tend to the farm! Well anyway I was getting jealous at the kids not having to go to school on alternate days, without having to see a doctor!  Well anyway I'm not staying in Boarding School for the next semester, and so my dad's going to get a timer fixed in my bloody computer. I hate that so much; what if I had a project that needed so much time to fix. I can see it now, that big red sign; 'You have exceeded the time limit. Please call your father if you would like to request for extra time!' Oh my gosh, why can't these people just trust me? But anyway, on the bright side, my computer can be re-booted now!  Sorry for having nothing to write, but there's a difficult challenge on Survivor Fire that my tribe is currently trailing in. So I've gotta help...         "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"05,June,2004","             Yeah... It's the June holidays and I'm kind of taking a little time off from my beloved blog. But anyway if there's anyone reading, today will be all about the French Open final between two wonderful players; Coria and Gaudio!  Well with all the drama and theatrics, it was absolutely impossible for me to keep away from this topic. First was the loss of a set to love by a frozen Gaudio. I kept my hopes alive of Gaudio winning, but after it reached 5-1 in the second set I thought it would be all over. But a spark can be re-lit in the presence of oxygen, I thought, and remembered how he climbed up from a 5-1 in the second against Nalbandian. For a moment that seemed to be the case, as he went up 5-3, but then he lost the set.  My Dad was saying that Gaudio did not deserve to be there, did not even deserve the challenge. My dear daddy, I thought to myself, ' In an unfair world it matters not that you deserve to be there, but that you are there!' The crowd was all behind Gaudio, and he climbed back up a set 6-4. Coria had strained a muscle, and was experiencing cramps. Huge drama it was when he was reduced to a snail's pace and lost a set!  In the final set both men were exhausted and Coria seemed to have recovered from his cramp. But anyway with crucial breaks at almost every turn, tension was high, the crowd was restless and the cheering could only be stopped by hitting a serve. All the rest was bullcrap tennis and really is not worth mentioning. Gaudio won in the end, after all his nervous laughter and his funny antics.  With all the drama and the theatrics, I believe that if I were on court that day I would win. Because I, for one, can act!         "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"05,June,2004","             Well looking at the amount of homework I've got for the June holidays, I really shouldn't be calling it the June holidays anymore. In fact, from now on I shall call it 'Home School.' Can you believe it? After the stupid SARS homework being posted on the internet, the school seems to have found more eco-friendly to have us print our own homework out. Like I said before, death iways a good option.  Anyway I really have nothing to write about. I'm basically posting for the sake of posting. So today, like I said a few posts before, I shall tell you about my friend Chun Ming. I've also said that I have no doubt my relationship with him is nothing but friendship, because I knew him before my hormones started raging.  First to his appearance. He has a really, really broad face, even broader than mine actually. He used to be really skinny and stalky, but now I've reached puberty and I've grown to be of equal height. And now he's sporting a bulging tummy that he doesn't want to bring up. Really, sometimes when you look at him he looks like a Chinese version of Barry Manilow and Clay Aiken crossed. Just that his face is growing just a little plumper. That too is something he doesn't want to bring up.  Now to his character. Obviously told by his growing body, he is a a rwally bubbly person, if you get my drift. His mouth can never stop complaining and talking. But unlike the 'Jenna Awardee' Samuel See, he spouts things that actually make sense. He is a creative thinker, like me and was involved in the OM competitions. He has a knick for shooting off his mouth sometimes, and the younger petty me got really angry with him once for letting off a secret of mine. But now he usually keeps his mouth in check. I have a wierd feeling that he'll make it well in the corporate world, but his stupid ambition is to be a teacher. His has however a whole list of ambitions; from owning a bus company to being the head of the Land Transport Authority. Any tourists to Singapore on a shoestring budget, go to him for help for public transport...          "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"31,July,2004","             Here is my supposed-to-be-unopiniated summary of the 4th leg of the race. I want to start off on a particular note, the note that basically says that Colin is a dirty, lowdown, son of a bitch. There, the start to my opinionless summary.  Ok so the teams got the clue at the pit stop, telling them to take a 20-hour bus ride to Buenos Aires, where they'll get their flights to Russia. Woohoo! New destination! Anyway, the teams arrived at the bus station one by one, and everything was closed. They agreed that they would get their tickets in the order to arrive, but when Colin & Christie talked to a ver sad man, they found here was a bus that left 3 hours later but still arrived at the same time. The queue rearranged, because of that scum of the earth. Mirna pissed off a few people, and drew an absolutely ucalled for 'Don't talk to me' when she tried to ask Lance what was happening. The piece of shit went and bought tickets for 4 other teams, because 'that's the order in which they were there.' Hello colin... I didn't see any queue!??!         The four behind teams rushed to the airport, where Charla & Mirna standbyed on a Swiss Air flight. I really don't know if they knew about the flight to Germany at this point, cause they were playing push barbie around the airport and not bothering to find another flight. The twins & Bowling moms worked together while Bob & Joyce had no time to look. And everyone left... Oooh! Look who's the business loser this time. Bob & Joyce got business class seats! Haven't they learnt from 4 previous seasons? Anyway, everyone leaves and Charla & Mirna are left behind. They unexpectedly catch the Marshall & Lance flight. Like I said, I don't know if they knew already that there was this flight, but if they did, they're the airline experts for this season.  So, everyone arrives in Russia, and they find the stupid battleship. Fro the first time since the first leg, we see the Yield! The Detour: Block 5 shots, in which the teams travel to a nearby skating ring and have to block 5 ice hockey slap shots. And Drink 1 shot, in which the teams had to travel further away to do this traditional drinking thing. It's obvious to me that the drinking was much easier, and unfair also cause Charla's arms length would be too short. For some reason, there's no pictures with Charla looking absolutely hilarious in the ice skating outfit.         They had to find a bronze horseman in the middle of St. Petersburg, which is a waste of time route marker cause they didn't do anything there. They were then told that they had to go the the Old Tower for the most exciting Roadblock ever. Caviar, the most expensive salt there is on the market. The favourite topping for the high society table was wasted on one of the best thought Roadblocks I've ever seen. 1 friggin kilogram per person, which makes a total of 8 kilos. Now if 100 grams cost about 50 bucks, 1kg wouls cost 500, and 8 would cost the producers a whopping S$4000!         Anyway, the sodium chloride imbalance in most of the eaters mentally balanced Chip, who finished it in monster speed. The only other guy who ate, Marshall, could not match up, but was still miserably fast. Brandon and Colin are IDIOTS! The best eater was Charla, followed by Joyce. Nicole fell terribly sick, which shows she already has a little imbalance on the caviar side. Christie did not fall as sick, which means she's perfectly normal. Oh what a chemically incorrect task, but who cares anyway?  The teams all made thier way to Catherine's Palace, their pit stop. Yadda and Bob & Joyce were eliminated! Now, the producers are going to have to pay for the huge water bills that the caviar eaters were going to drink.                 "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"27,July,2004","             Amazing Race's Sports Injury by  Ethan Alter    The Amazing Race's father-daughter duo, Jim and Marsha, got off to the roughest start of any team. After Jim took a tumble on the Santa Monica boardwalk and ripped up his knee, they were forced to go to the hospital, and nearly missed the first airline flight of the race. But they never gave up, battling their way into third place on the second leg. Their luck gave out Tuesday night though, as plane problems grounded them for good.     Ethan: So Jim, how's the leg?     Jim:  Oh, it's fine now. The stitches actually popped out five minutes after we were on the airplane. At that point, I was just concerned about infection, so I was taking antibiotics. Eventually, it went away and now I've got a nice souvenir scar.   Marsha:  He doesn't have feeling in the top of his kneecap though. He never mentions that part. But that's my dad, I guess.    Ethan: I'm still impressed that they were able to sew your wound up so quickly.     Jim:  That's actually a funny story. The nurse was taking her time, and I knew I had to get her on my side. She said, 'I don't understand why you just can't take the next flight to Uruguay.' So I said, 'You don't understand, I have to get on that flight. I didn't want to tell you this, but I'm a producer and I'm filming a show in Uruguay. My camera crew is already on that plane. It's going to cost millions and millions of dollars if we have to delay the production.' And she goes, 'What kind of show are you making? Is it some sort of animal show?' I saw a spark in her eye and said, 'Yes, it's an animal show.' She said 'Oh, really?' and then ran and got another doctor and a paramedic and all three of them did the procedure together. And then she said, 'Okay, you go ahead and produce your show, but no running and no jumping.'   Marsha:  She gave him a narcotic for pain and Dad threw it away because he didn't want to have a fuzzy head. All that injury and no pain medicine, I was so proud of him. We felt so victorious walking to the flight — I could hear the Rocky music in my head!       Ethan: Settle another issue: Did those bowling moms lie to you?     Marsha:  We still don't know. We overheard them talking to some locals, but they weren't discretely talking to them. It was like they were trying to lure other teams into listening, and I totally fell for it. After we got to the exchange booth and no one else was there, we figured they had tricked us. But then we wound up beating them to the pit stop and we thought that maybe we were just so wrapped up in the race that we misunderstood. We never confronted them about it and they probably had no hand in it. I can't wait to talk to them and say, 'We're sorry for saying such nasty things about you!'    Ethan: What happened to you at the Buenos Aires airport? That was confusing.     Marsha:  I told the woman behind the counter to book us on the 9:10 flight, but there was only one seat left. So I had her book me on that flight and put Dad on the standby list. I also asked her to confirm us for the 10:30 flight. I think confusion arose because Brandon and Nicole — whom I never should have helped in the first place after they screwed us over on the first leg — asked us to buy their tickets, too. So now I'm asking for a lot of tickets, and I guess the lady got confused. In her mind, she said, 'Well, Marsha's got a ticket for the 9:10, so I'll put Jim and Brandon and Nicole on the 10:30.' So I think we're set and then Dad sees that I don't have a ticket for the 10:30 flight.   Jim:  She made the mistake of not giving us the tickets that we asked for and I made the mistake of not checking the tickets at the counter. Once we got back to the counter and realized she wasn't going to admit her mistake, we got the airport manager in on it and even she couldn't do anything. But we still didn't think we were sunk because we were first on the standby list for the 10:30 flight. So we get to the gate and they start calling out all the standby passengers, except us. We asked what was going on and the guy didn't even look at us. It was very apparent that we were not getting on that plane. He took Kami and Karli ahead of us, even though we were first on the list. I don't know how that happened. They may have done something behind the scenes that we didn't see.  Marsha: Or maybe he just thought blonds were cuter than brunets. [Laughs]    Ethan: You got on the 11:30 plane instead. Did you have any hope of catching up?     Marsha:  The episode didn't indicate this, but our plane was actually delayed for another 30 minutes. Once we landed, we ran a really quick race. If it wasn't for those 30 minutes, I think we could have caught up to Marshall and Lance. The producers even told us later that we were really close to beating those guys.           "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"23,July,2004","             Ok... That title is entirely random and hysterical. But anyway, this is my comments on each individual team on the third leg of the race, with teams showing their flight arrangement skills for the first time. The first leg isn't counted cause the flight arrangements were printewd on their Route infos...  Colin & Christie -- A first place finish was entirely unearned. They were featured much more this time than in the previous episodes, and we all saw that there's really nothing much to them. They're only first because of their ability, if you can even consider it an ability, to outrun Charla. There will come a point in the race where the team will face some immense difficulty, and this team will crumble because of Chrisie's inability to keep calm and be nice. Colin is a great racer, with his ability to keep calm and his classy aggressiveness in getting his plane tickets. Christie, on the other hand, will do nothing except to bring the team down.  Charla & Mirna -- Charla & Mirna showed that they had mental powress that could overcome a lot of physical obstacles again. They are paying for it, with Charla having limited choices to make in the physical tasks. I love it that they're so aggressive but can still work well together, but they need to be nicer to the other teams. I know they're policy is to be nice to those who are nice to them, but they do not need to flare up at those who aren't. If they didn't flare up today I think they'll be in a good position to go very far, but at this point, a Yeild might be the price to pay for being mean. Boo Mirna! Charla is having a hell lot of fun in the race, except the part where she turned into a chocolate loving frankenstein after getting electrocuted. It's sad that they made an alliance with people they cannot trust... They really need to use their Yeild power now, with most effect on Marshall & Lance.  Brandon & Nicole -- Nicole first; it wasn't a smart move revealing your bond with Charla & Mirna at the airport. I fully agree with Mirna on this one. One good thing is that she has revealed herself to not be the whiny one in this race, cause Christie is the one that has gone miles ahead of her in this area. Brandon seems to be the only one in this team, taking the reins in trying to find flights, doing the tasks cause he's stronger, and according to him has a bigger stomach for chocolate. I have to give the team their props on getting to the 2nd flight, cause I really didn't see them working. Maybe it was just dumb luck. It was really despicable of this team to go leave Charla & Mirna in the lurch like that, with possibly no flight out.   Bob & Joyce -- I'm actually starting to like this team, of course under a certain influence. They've been consistent in their 4th - 5th place finishes even with their lack of physicality. They weren't featured much in this episode, but I think they can use their age more to their advantage while getting flights. Too mild to fight off the aggressive teams at the moment, but sneak under the covers and be really, really nice, and you'll get pecedence over the others when it comes to this area. Maybe the world of internet dating isn't so bad after all...  Kami & Karli -- They got really lucky with the flights this week, but it might just die on them next week. Their characters are so similar that it is impossible to tell between the 2. Didn't notice much of them this leg, except for the fact that they keep bumping into Chip & Kim everywhere. Really showed their stupidity by missing the strip of shallow water leading to the island. Coupled with them walking right past the cluebox last week, I will safely quote my friend saying, 'They use their legs more than their eyes.' Big Question: Will they be back battling for last place with Chip & Kim? Definitely yes, and they'll hopefully be joined by Marshall & Lance.  Linda & Karen -- Karen's definitely the better racer in this team. She's giving way to Linda the big chicken by letting her do the easier, more enjoyable tasks. Linda will definitely bring the team down at some point, and Karen won't be able to do anything to stop it. Unless Karen has the angel-like temperament of Zach last season, she will also not be able to take the heat and will collapse with exhaustion at having to give way to her much weaker teammate.  Chip & Kim -- Back in third to last place, and Chip declares that they're moving up, slowly but surely. Surely you realise the elimination cut off point is moving up faster than you are. Chip didn't really show any of his idiotic qualities this week, but I'm sure it'll come out next week. Hopefully we get to see whichever one, the twins or them, get to the Yeild and try and kill one another. Chip is such and idiot but doesn't use his meaness meaningfully, like in getting his tickets.  Marshall & Lance -- Marshall & Lance was the team that really deserved to go this week. I said already that I wouldn't mind, and wouldn't be surprised if these 2 went. I'm going to say that again this week... I give them their props for getting the second flight out, but that 'I'm dead' attitude at the roadblock probably would've made 10 white chocolates go down his throat without them noticing. The guy that wasn't doing to roadblock wasn't helping. Showing your frustration at you teammate is never a good idea. They are really boring, and ti sure looks like they get into trouble next week.  Jim & Marsha -- This pair definitely could've made it together. They're like the nice guy team this time aroung beside Bob & Joyce, and we would've loved to see them go further. As much as I don't want to, I have to bash them for their lack of skill in getting plane tickets. Really horrid that you managed to get tickets for someone else on the flight you weren't booked on. And in the whole race I've never, ever heard of only one team member being booked on a flight... Sad. They stayd positive till the end and there's a plus point for them.         "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"22,July,2004","             This to me was the best episode yet! With the dating couples ending their losing streak, and a proper, fun Roadblock and an even choice for Detour. The only sad thing was that the photo album is short of any good pictures. Boo the editors! Give me the photos, and I'll pick out the good ones for you...  Ok, so the teams left the pit stop in Buenos Aires. Brandon & Nicole got stuck in the mud, and Charla & Mirna, thinking they were friends, stopped to get them help. Charla , in the process, got electrocuted by an innocent looking fence. Poor her! The first betrayal: Charla & Mirna go on a different path. Brandon & Nicole, a few feet behind them, don't even bother honking to warn them...  At the airport, Brandon & Nicole found that all the counters were closed, and they decided to try to call for information. The earliest flight, at 9.10am, was full. The next flight, they thought, was at 10.30am. Everyone queued at the Argetina Airlines counter, but Marshall & Lance decided to go out and investigate. This I have to give them props for. Unless you have no time left, do not be satisfied with what you have. Charla & Mirna followed suit, and hearing that there was a 9.40 flight, ran to a ticketing counter just across the hall, lining before Marshall & Lance. Jim & Marsha helped Brandon & Nicole get tickets, which again violated Nicole's promise to help Charla & Mirna get tickets. In the end, Charla & Mirna, and a very lucky Colin & Christie, without Christie's help, got on to the 9.10 flight.         With that, the teams made their way to Bariloche, Argentina one by one, in 4 seperate flights. They were supposed to find the mayor of the place, but surprise, surprise, there's no picutre of him in the photo gallery. Anyway, from there, the clue directed them to a chocolate factory. Their task there was to chomp through 11000 chocolates to find 1 of 20 with a white centre. To me, and a few teams, this sounded like an easy, almost pleasurable task. However, people almost puked at the amount of chocolate they had to wolf down. I think it wouldn't have been a problem for Mr. Sweet tooth here, but I really haven't eaten that much at one go... So who knows? Charla proved that she was a little monster by zipping past Colin to receive a clue from her dwarf friend. How cute, or rather, coincidental.         Ok, so they head to a mountain thingy where they had to choose between 'Rough Riding' or 'Smooth Sailing'. Nobody chose rough riding but it was a ride down a rough hill that is nothing scary, but slow. To me, the fear of falling down on a rough slope and feeling pain is much more than the fear of heights. Smooth sailing required the teams to go parasailing! Well, all the teams had fun!         After the parasailing was the pit stop. A little island connected to the main piece of land by a strip of shallow water... You know that kind of dreamy thing... Kami & Karli went temporarily blind and swam across insted of walking. But other than that, nothing happened. Aand Jim & Marsha were eliminated, if you were wondering...         "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"18,July,2004","             Amazing Race Exes Get Evil by  Ethan Alter  &nbsp; Alison and Donny It's often said that time heals all wounds. Apparently, that maxim doesn't hold true for Alison and Donny, the bickering couple who went from first to last during the second leg of The Amazing Race. In this exclusive Q&amp;A with TV Guide Online, the estranged pair of losers air their grievances and let loose with a few well-aimed barbs. This unpleasant exchange is about as real as reality TV gets, Race fans. Buckle your seatbelts!  &nbsp;  Interviewer:   Alison, why did you decide to do another reality show so soon after Big Brother 4?    Alison:  I got an e-mail from CBS asking if Donny and I wanted to do The Amazing Race together. I asked him, and he said he wanted to do it. Of course, I wasn't going to be the one to hold him back from winning $1 million and I was also all about trying to win $1 million. So we mutually decided to do it.  &nbsp;  Interviewer:   Aside from the obvious, how did the two experiences differ?    Alison:  Well, here you had to work with teams, and that sucked for me. It was a lot easier to do things on my own and do things the way I wanted to do them. During the race, you have to be impulsive and quick and if you make the wrong decision — or if you let someone else make the wrong decision — then you're done.  &nbsp;  Interviewer:   Donny, why did you agree to sign on?   Donny:  Pretty much just for the opportunity to travel around the world on someone else's dollar. That's something you can never pass up. Neither of us had ever seen Amazing Race before, so we didn't know what we were getting ourselves into. And most of the people on the show have been fans for life. I'm sure a couple of teams had diagrams in their basement of everything that's happened on every single episode. We were almost going in there blindfolded.  &nbsp;  Interviewer:   How did you prepare for the race?    Donny:  We were on the computer until four in the morning some nights doing straight-up research. You could tell from the first episode that we knew what we were doing, because we were the only people who actually asked which flight got there first. We did everything we possibly could to be prepared. We just tried to be overcautious at a certain point, and it didn't help much.  &nbsp;  Interviewer:   Did you have a strategy going in?    Alison:  We wanted me to be the brains and for him to be the physical aspect of the race. And in last night's episode, we kind of switched that a little bit. Donny decided to be mental as well, and that's kind of where we messed up.   Donny:  The race was way easier to do than dealing with her.  &nbsp;  Interviewer:   Was it difficult to watch yourselves argue like that?    Donny:  Not at all. I knew exactly what to expect. There were no surprises.   Alison:  It was difficult for me. I didn't realize that all the name-calling would be coming from his end, and the things he said after the race. I didn't realize any of that would happen. That was a big shock for my friends and family, too. [He] was somebody I had trusted and confided in and for him to say such hurtful things killed me.   Donny:  Okay, well, don't let your tears get in the way, because you're no angel.   Alison:  Oh, I didn't cry, don't worry.  &nbsp;  Interviewer:   I guess this brings up the relationship question. Where do things stand now between the two of you?    Donny:  There's no relationship whatsoever. There's no speaking terms or anything. It ended the day the race was over.   Alison:  No, that's not true. I moved in with him and his family for a couple of months after the race — I don't know why you're deciding to lie. Things were actually fine after the race for a while. Then, I found out that Donny was not only verbally rude to me, he was cheating on me as well. So I decided to leave him.  Donny:  That's a good one, but no.   Interviewer:  Are you still living in the same city?   Donny:  We're not anywhere near each other.   Alison:  I moved like five states away, actually. Surprised, Donny? [Silence]   Alison:  He doesn't know.   Donny:  He doesn't care.  &nbsp;  Interviewer: Getting back to the race for a moment, what happened with the bus to the cattle ranch? That seemed to be the point where you really fell behind.    Donny:  We had no clue that there would be stops along the way. We thought, first-class bus, first-class seats, it would be direct the entire way. We also thought it was the only bus that went there. The other teams that got to the bus station after us found another bus that got there faster. At the point we got on the bus, we thought we were either first or last.   Alison:  I knew we were last.  &nbsp;  Interviewer: Knowing what you know now, what's one thing you would do differently if you ran the race over again?    Alison:  I definitely would not go on the show with Donny. It was sad because last night, all my ex-boyfriends were calling me, asking, 'Why were you ever dating him?' and 'Why did you go on the show with him instead of me?' That's the one thing I'd definitely change. I wouldn't have let him think. I wouldn't let him use his brains, if that's what you wanna call them.   Donny:  Well, your good looks got us nowhere, so don't worry about it.   Alison:  Hey, neither did yours.   Donny:  I would take the midget instead of her.  (Whoever the hell thought Alison was a bitch, look here!)  &nbsp;  Interviewer: Um, so... All in all, are you glad you did this?    Alison:  Yeah, I'm definitely glad.   Donny:  I'm glad I got to travel around the world with someone I hated.   Alison:  Maturity shines through...          "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"17,July,2004","             I'm still wondering why I have so much to blog about this week... So happening! Well, anyway, I will never let anyone copy outside of my presence again. Yes... If you haven't already inferred, someone got caught copying my work. &nbsp; The worst thing about it all was that the person that caught the copycat was the Maths Dean. Anyone in 3.16 would know that the maths dean can be one hell of a bitch. Oh yes... Did I mention that she was a close friend of my mother's? Well I was relieved when my maths teacher told me I was 'almost' called up, which meant that I wasn't called up. But what happened was even worst. The Maths Dean made a personal call to my mom, telling her to 'keep a closer eye on him.' Oh... And you know what she told my mom? 'He was involved in a copying case.' Wow! That's specific enough... My mom actually thought I copied in my maths test, cause I was struggling with a question the day before. And I'll bet she'll get suspiscious should my results come out perfect. &nbsp; What a bitch... I really should get my maths teacher to clear this matter up. Call my mom then... Tell her that I'm getting my work copied instead of me copying... Now that will solve everything, cause she won't really care if I get As for everything while the rest of my class fails... HEHE!          "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"17,July,2004","             I just peeked into my sister's blog, actually delved into it. I really don't think she expected me to do so... I mean, why would I be interested? Well, I realised that evrything she tells us is what she tells her friends on her blog... So much for family... It really doesn't say much of the complexity of her mind, does it? She is as easy to read as a book... And me being a Literature student, I can read between the lines. &nbsp; Well, there's a comment on her blog about me having nothing to say. That's just because I've been alone all these years. You always with my other sister, and Mum always with Dad. I've never had a permanent companion. I kind of think mom sensed it... That's why till now I have a maid to 'take care of me.' It's kind of like Survivor isn't it? With two prominent alliances and me as the swing. &nbsp; I really can't believe my older sister thinks that I'm having problems at school. It's so stupid...&nbsp;Do my results show any problems? Somethimes people like to be left alone, so shut your overly huge trap and pinch your gigantic nose cause I am not having any problems at school! I really hate it that she keeps telling me about prayer and how it changes things. It seems so super artificial and hypocritical, especially with your kind of situation and most of all your detestable character. &nbsp; I cannot get why my sis is so transparent, when I'm so complex in character. Haha... I'm too complex for anyone to read me, not even my parents. Thinking about it I realise how I never miss her when she's gone... How I never miss anyone but my dad. Could it be that I'm the Kingshaw of this story? Ohh... That's sad... Maybe it's because the girls in the family have never been too highly intellectual, and I'm only able to mix with those people, and in the case of my family, only with my dad...          "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"17,July,2004","             Yes, the 'programme' I was referring to is the CIP I had on Thursday at Macritchie Reserve. We had to walk 1 hour in and out of the area we were supposed to go to and it was all counted for our CIP hours. How nice is that? I calculated a total work time of 1.5 hours, and it is clocked at 6 hours. Not that I'm complaining, but wouldn't it be better if we walked into an office to do 6 hours of proper community work? Then again, the Physical Education &amp; Aesthetics department has never been known for their efficiency... It was really more fun than work, especially with the antics of the dynamic trio we know as our class teachers! &nbsp; Mrs Toh was dressed much more formally than she would in class, but maybe it's because she wears clothes that look like a house elf's rag to class. With her age catching up on her, you wouldn't be expecting her to bend down to pick up weeds would you? Very surprisingly, she was actually sppeding up the hill to go weeding. Maybe the biologically enhanced foods have something to do with it. When she actually started weeding, it looked like she was tending to her garden. Staying in one spot, it was as if she was looking after her plot of flowers. When we were done, she beamed at us and told us the huge pile in the middle of the path was her's. Halfway done the hill, she actually started running, as in really running. ' To the aircon!' she yelled as our incredulous faces looked up at her. &nbsp; Mr Sham kind of thought he was Tarazan... He was looking for all the vines hanging on trees and tried to swing on them. He really showed a wild side of himself when he joined in the tug-of-war with the tree. Actually, I thought he lowered himself to my class' level of intelligence, which is not at all very high. But I tell you something... He actually has a car! I mean, it was pretty shocking to see a Malay teacher have a car, but his car wasn't even the typical Malay second hand car, it was a nice, middle-class car. Well... Call me racist, but Malays are never known to be rich are they? &nbsp; Deven was the most embarassing thing ever. He was trying overly hard to be funny, incorporating his little bit of Physics into a weed pulling activity. He was being blatantly ridiculed by Ashok and Anjan, but I have a feeling he really didn't know it. When I told him in his accent to 'apply the force' on the weed, he threatened to 'apply the force on your face!' I guess I don;t look Indian enough... Or maybe my imitation was too good. After we went back to home ground to retrieve our bags, Ashok caught a caterpillar meant to scare Mr Sham. Mr Sham managed to a certain extent hide his fear, but when Deven saw it he was totally mortified. He was saved by the ranger asking Ashok to put it back, and later gave the lame excuse of it having the possibility of being poisonous.           "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"16,July,2004","             Yeah... I was forced to buy tickets for the Festival of Arts. If I had to spend my time and money on something, it would definitely be Drama. Even though I knew that the storyline had no backbone, it was still better than going into a sleeping room with the music teams. So yes... My very professional comments on the performance:  &nbsp;  Storyline -- The storyline is a failure. Anybody and everybody could see that. But this was meant mostly for inter-school fun, so the storyline doesn't exactly matter. The author of the script is definitely not a thinker.  &nbsp;  Script(dialogue) -- Amidst a sea of puns and witty comments, the script wasn't exactly too smooth flowing. It was really good enough for a school performance like that, just that it wasn't perfect. The witty asides are what's best in the script, and this is where most of the Drama Club sriptwriting skills shine. For the simple and nonsensical storyline, the script was almost too good.  &nbsp;  Characters -- The characters in the script are absolutely perfect. Each one represents the typical, overboard NS men often talked about. The Nerd, the Macho, the 'on' one, the totally queer one, the 'good future' one, and the 'cannot live without home' one. Sadly, the very interesting subject of Malay logic was not touched on.&nbsp; Malays are one of the main components of army life, without whom the&nbsp;NS experience is not complete. With a repetition of the 'nerd' and the 'good future', I really don't see why they couldn't do a dim-witted Malay. Super extreme cliches work well with the nonsensical storyline,&nbsp;but incomplete experience just makes the cast a little less than perfect. &nbsp;  Entertainment value -- Why do people watch comedies? To let loose, and have fun. With the flimsy storyline, the entertainment value had better be up there above perfection. Yes... Very much laughable, but definitely not high-level humour. After a while, the humour became very much corny and overused. I still do like the parts where the actors break into absolutely ridiculous and out of point dances. Their ability to incorporate a little musical influence really impressed me. It was the most highly intellectual humour in the whole script. &nbsp; Overall rating: Good, but not rememberable. 3/5!&nbsp;            "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"15,July,2004","             Ok... Here's the comments on the teams that I bring every reality show I watch. That is if we here at Singapore aren't too behind... I titled the post perky underdogs cause the underdogs seem to really be having fun on the race! Go the underdogs! Here's the whatever I promised stuff...  Brandon & Nicole -- I said last week that much was expected of this team, but they underperformed last leg. This leg, however, was a totally different story. They showed no negative signs, no whining, and no complaining. Nicole, however, may be a little too inactive for my liking. Poor her getting shagged in a foreign country, and all her boyfriend did was look for his balls(pun!). Bad Boy... They got a little lucky with the cemeterys, having their taxi driver correct them...  Charla & Mirna -- GOGOGOGO the little one! I love you Charla! She absolutely rocked the episode with her punk dancing, her ballerina twirling and her 'stick your hand up the cow's behind' comment. It wasn't exactly fair that they got on the common ferry, but who cares right? It does make up for her inability to run, and she paid for it again at the foot race to the pit-stop. All I'm afraid of is that Mirna will feel like she's doing everything for the team, which is so untrue. I think Charla helped more with the slab of beef in the first leg. Nicole & Brandon are getting along well with them, so maybe, hopefully, the mentioned alliance next week is them. Then Brandon can carry Charla during a foot race! Ahh... I sense the first working Amazing Race alliance even before I see it! And did you see Mirna's face when she hugged Phil? Hilarious!  Jim & Marsha -- Wowzer! This team shocked me with their 3rd place finish. Who would expect the weakest team last leg to come out so strong this leg. Victims of the bowling moms? LOSERS! Ok... it was really bad of the moms to play so dirty, but who would believe that a middle class country like Argentina doesn't accept US currency? Even we in Singapore accept US currency! I really like it, however, that they finished in front of those moms. Rub it in their faces people!  Linda & Karen -- Who would expect the moms to be such home-bred bitches? Firstly, they've not heard of a foam party... Superbly stupid... And then they, like those bloody cowards in class, bully those weaker than them. How low can you go? I really, honestly, hope that these 2 go down next week. Who knows? we may get to see Charla jumping on her trampoline tummy... Btw, I thought the 'You outsmarted a cow' comment was serious on their part. And I still don't know which is Linda and which is Karen...  Marshall & Lance -- Who? What? Where? After a fluke showing on the first leg of the race, this team proved that they teams cannot be judged on just 1 leg of the race. They are so insignificant because they are humourless and entirely serious. Who was it claiming to be the Ken & Gerard of the race again? This team needs to go soon... They are of no interest to us viewers.  Bob & Joyce -- Really, really horrible leg for these 2, and they still managed to stay in. First, the wrong cemetery... A little luck was involved of course, but they could have simply told the driver Evita Peron and he would've known where to go. No... I have to speak in their native style... Chacarita! Chacarita your way home soon people! Oops... Sorry if I just cursed you... Anyway, really bad call with the detour. Just because you like dogs doesn't mean the dogs are easier. Matching the face is much easier than walking one mile!  Colin & Christie -- Same comments as last week. This team definitely has chemistry together, and a lot is expected of them. However, they have failed to show us any of their outstanding abilities. I really wouldn't be surprised seeing these 2 eliminated the next time. I wouldn't be too upset either! They're getting monotonous and are sinking into the depths of Marshall & Lance's oblivion. If they don't show well the next time, I will have absolutely nothing left to say...  Chip & Kim -- Chip's a bastard. Need I say more? Yes I do! They sank as low as the bowling moms this time, playing it absolutely dirty. I have to say though, the stand off in the cab was a very smart tactical move, and it was absolute fairplay, even though some might not admit it. I'm sure that everyone rather him be nicer and let the bloody taxi go. Well these 2 have got to take a taxi and go home soon, cause I have a feeling next episode Chip will show more of his torrid qualities that I will surely hate.  Kami & Karli -- Poor little babes got stood up by that bloody Chip. Really respectable that they managed to finish the dog walking task even though they hated dogs. Maybe it's because they're so catty... There seems to be a significant twist in the detours this season; one is much easier than the other. They're enemity with Chip & Kim will push them to use the 'Yield' next episode... I hope! These 2 teams will continue to battle for the last team in, I can feel it.  Alison & Donny -- What a bummer. Donny's a strong guy, but maybe he's too dimwitted. Alison's a weak girl, but she's smart. These 2 make a really dynamic duo, but queerly they were booted so early. Alison confirmed she's a bitch by walking away so defiantly from her partner after getting eliminated.           "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"15,July,2004","             Ok... Here's my blow by blow summary of what happened on the second leg of the race. This week's picture album totally sucked, with no pictures of the tango detour. Very queerly, 50% of the pictures were of the foam party at te 'Shake' place,when on TV they only spent 5 mins there. The poster of the photographs was also crazy, cause Kami & Karli have so many pics when Bob & Joyce have none...  Ok, so you know they were in Uruguay when they stopped. They received the clue to go to the pub 'Shake' in the Uraguaian downtown. The little lady went the wrong way, which I was absolutely pissed at cause Brandon & Nicole were right there for them to follow. The bowling moms surprised me with their navigation skills as they took over Alison & Donny to reach the pub first. Meanwhile, Charla & Mirna chanced upon a hooker!  Amazing Quote at this point(says Mirna to Charla about the hooker): She's pissed now cause we're talking to her when she's got business to do.         And so the teams reached the pub one by one. Brandon & Nicole were the ones victimised by the task, with Nicole getting squeezed in the context of trying to burst her beach ball. Ok... That sounds sick! Ok, yeah! She gets touched and shagged, and for a moment I thought the guy was going to rape her under the foam while Brandon minded his business with the balls. That sounds sick again! Ok... The creepy face in the picture is probably the molester...         From the part house they were supposed to go to the port to take a ferry to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Charla & Mirna missed the ferry. I mean if Charla was normal they'd have missed it. Again... MANIPULATION! The little lady actually used her disability to her advantage again. I have a feelin this is going to be the trend for as long as they are here. She is one power pack... Getting the ferry to wait for the 'Guest of Honour'. Go the little one!  They got to Argentina and had to go to Evita's resting place. It was a cemetery called Recoleta, but a few teams got the wrong cemetery, going to Chacarita, where Evita's Husband, the president, was buried. It is absolutely disrespectful of the producers to make the teams run into the cemetery like that. Oh, and Charla & Mirna caught a buggy which decided it would help a 'little lady'.  Amazing Quote at this point(says Mirna to buggy driver): Little lady here! Little lady here!  And the teams received a clue for the Detour. Yay! In tango, teams had to travel 1.5 miles on any preferred mode of transport to El Tango, where they would receive a picture of one of the dancers. Then, they would have to enter in a horribly lit, beautiful and atmospheric theatre, where a large number of people were doint the tango. Recognise the face. Very difficult in the dim light, but still easier than walking 8 unruly hounds 1 mile. That was of course in Perro! Teams had to deal with hyper active dogs that sometimes were overly horny for their own good. Only Kami & Karli and Bob & Joyce completed this task.  Amazing Quote at this point(says Alison to the dog): You can't keep having sex!         From there, the teams went to a cow farm. What's it with cows this time? First, slaughtered, bloody cows. Then now its alive and fast cows... Oh the irony! Anyway the roadblock clue read: 'The person that's doing this task must have fast hands and fast feet'.   Amazing Quote at this point(says Charla to Mirna): You may have to stick your hand up the cow's ass.  And anyway, the teams did not have to do that. all they had to do was get a bananda off the cow's neck. Luckily Charla didn't step up to stick her hand up the cow's ass cause she would have been trampled to death.         All the blah and teams had to go on a horse carraige to their next pit stop.        Oh yes... Did I mention that Alison and Donny were eliminated? What a shocker. I really don't know what to say after 2 most expected couples got eliminated first... *hums away*         Opinions and views on teams will be posted later tomorrow I kind of tired now... And there's school tomorrow. *Sighs*          "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"13,July,2004","             Yes... I'm pissed again! That Jenna I was telling you about is rally becoming the most irritating and impetuous bastard I have ever seen. Samuel See Boyao, a mention of that very name and I feel like puking my existence out of myself. He is a friggin deperate asshole who laughs like a bloody Hyena. He is such a desperate wuss that he needed a loser last year to introduce him to a loser girl. One look at his screwed up face and you'll know why he's so bloody desperate. Stupid, low class and unhumouring idiocracy is what I will describe his life as...  Well, he's really not as bad as the bitch of the class I will term as the 'Deena Awardee'. Being a secretary of the class he seems to hold more power than anybody else in the class. For some reason he doesn't dare face the class, has absolutely no confidence and charisma, but in front of the teachers... Ooh, that's a totally different story! 'Oh Mr Deven, so and so didn't do duty yesterday...' 'Oh Mrs Toh, can you ask them to donate $2 to the class fund?' Wanna be responsible boy? Start doing your own Maths homework and handing it up on time first! Hypocrites are those I hate the most...  Oh yes... Have I added that he's a bloody faggot? He flirts with that German student in the class only because he has influence over teachers. Definitely a good person for his re-nomination bid next year. Well kid, if it is a re-election bid, say bye bye to your power, and guess who moves in to your place? Haha... ME! No one supports your 'It's against the school rules...' (in a whiny voice) stand. No one ever listens to the feeble and suddenly without a teacher unauthoratative 'No balls allowed...'Who is the one who is gaining respect from everyone; the social groups, the uncool people, the smart gang and even the ruggers? ME! You think you got itsy bitsy control over your puny German ally? I kind of think he would want me to be in your place FAGGOT!         "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"10,July,2004","             Here are the actual highlights of this leg, not my opinion!  The first thing the teams did when thet arrived in Uruguay was to find this hand on a beach. Supposedly it is the 'Last thing you see of a drowning person.' I really like it. Who'd think that you have an art form besides thosed stupid sandcastles on a beach.         From the big hand the teams went into the tree area where they hunted for ferry tickets. They took a ferry to an islan and went to a meat farm to recieve their next clue. At the meat farm, they found out that they had to carry a huge slab of beef to a meat shop. It was a very uncreative challenge, and my favourite team, Charla & Mirna, lost their lead because of the sheer physicality of it. I feel that for a team to gain a lead using their wits, and then to lose it because of their disability, is super unfair. Boo the producers!         Then came the Detour: Chips or Zips. Chips involve the team going into a casino to play a game of roulette. The teams start off with 20 chips, of which they can only use 5 at a time. They must match the number of the landing to get their next clue. My call, 4 attempts of 5 chips each will take you less than 10 minutes. Just bloody well try your luck! For some reason, there are no pics of them playing chips. Zips involve teams having to cross buildings on a zipline, then descend almost 20 storeys into the pool on another. That will take them about 20-30 mins at my guess. Might as well chips first, then try the zips!         Here's the pit stop photo which they didn't have in their photo album, It's different from the other photos, cause it's in a different section of the site...        That's all with their limited photo album. But Dennis & Erika, my initial favourite team, got eliminated! Sucks...                 "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"07,July,2004","             Amazing Race? Definitely! I don't see why CBS hesitated so much about bringing this season back, cause from the first episode, I can totally tell this season's going to be absolutely awesome! My comments on the teams... Well sorry they're up so bloody late, my sis's been hogging the com!  Alison & Donny -- Everybody hates me, nobody likes me! I thought that Alison would come in with that mentality, but no, only her little Donny is upset with her, or so she thinks. Overall this is a strong team, even though I hate to admit it! I really don't see any place where Alison can lie and cheat in this game. Flirting, is a whole new story. Maybe, since flirting can only be done at the pit-stops off camera, she can slvage her deviled reputation.  Marshall & Lance -- Who the hell? How the hell? When they reached the pit-stop, I was like, 'How did they get there?' They played an extremely insignificant role in this episode. It's either they are simply a boring team, or CBS is trying to keep them low cause they win the race. If another alpha-male team wins this time, I'm not going to be too happy, especially if it's this boring pair that thinks they're the Jon & Al and Ken & Gerard of this season. They might as well say they're the Rob & Brennan and Chris & Alex, since they're the only alpha males!  Karen & Linda -- Surprise, surprise! The bowling moms can actually do something. Do you actually belive that bowling is a sport mommies? The answer to that question lies in your physical condition. They only got eliminated by a smart but to a certain extent unfair twist in the flights. I mean they probably didn't even know that the second flight arrived earlier. I really liked it that they worked together in carrying that slab of beef. They weren't even tired after they completed the task. That's about the only thing rememberable that they did in this leg...  Bob & Joyce -- Our quiet couple of this race. They are very mild and nice people. Their lack in physicality, I believe, will bring them down in this race. They migh fluke like Teri & Ian, but I really don't think so. Letting the man do everything, my dear Joyce, is not right. You sould've help carry his backpack while he carried the beef. They remind me of an old couple in my church. The man had a stroke...  Charla & Mirna -- What can I say? GO GO GO THE LITTLE ONE!!!!! She said that she was here to break all stereotypes about dwarves, but to me she just displayed the exact thing I expected! I mean, after Gimli's performance in Lord of the Rings, I kind of think everyone's stereotype of a dwarf is: stubborn, strong headed and determined. She really impressed me with her firepower, zipping around everywhere like she was a cat on a race. Well she is on a race... Mirna's having the hots for Phil, that's going to be real funny! Too bad that we don't get to see the 12-hour intervals.  Brandon & Nicole -- Shame on you 2. Admidst high expectations, these 2 surely did not perform. They got on the second flight, and the twist in the flights surely saved them. Everyone, including myself, thinks they look like a carbon copy of Flo & Zach. They have in fact, displayed traits of being Flo & Zach. Nicole started whining in this episode, and it looks like she may be on her way to a number one spot that Flo has taken. Brandon, has not displayed Zach's wits, and basically that will bring this team down. Both models are heading for disaster with their most probable brainlesness (think Derek & Drew), but I'm looking forward to seeing whether they can beat Millie & Chuck in their christian proclaimations. Prediction, 4-5 place (think Derek & Drew and Millie & Chuck).  Colin & Christie -- The predicted power couples are surely not performing here, with Brandon & Nicole already down, these 2 went even 'downer.' They had the flight twist to blame, unlike the previous pair. I mean, who would expect such a smart, but evil twist? I really love their charisma and chemistry together. I do think they'll go far in this race.  Chip & Kim -- I do not like this team. There you have it straight in the face! Call me racist, call me anything you want, I DO NOT like this team. Firstly, they do not have the charisma and chemistry that the other couples have. Secondly, they made an absolutely stupid mistake. How can there be a task without the information? Booyah! I absolutely did not think they would make it to the pit stop so quickly. But I really pitied them. Phil should've just imposed a time penalty and got them over with it.  Kami & Karli -- They say the word 'manipulating' in a creepy, blonde way! All I want to say is mostly the same as Chip & Kim. Move away girls, Charla and Mirna are the smart ones that are going to manipulate Charla's glaring disability. The question is, do these bimbos do better than the himbos of last season? Probably not!  Jim & Marsha -- I would love to see Jim interact with Marshall. Imagine this, 'Hi! I'm Marshall...' with Jim replying, 'Really, I was only a captain!' Haha, sorry I'm being so lame. I kind of think he named his daughter afer the word Marshall... How stupid! Tearing your leg in the first few seconds just means this team is entirely incapable. Being the first Father/Daughter team, they are a huge dissappointment.  Dennis & Erika -- This team had the chemistry, the character and the charisma. It was really sad to see that they didn't have enough aggressiveness to be in the race. It was a sad, sad first bootee. It never pays to be nice in every reality show. I really thought Jim & Marsha deserved the boot more than these 2 did, but adious anyway!          "

The Greeks let in the Trojan horse and boom, the Trojans get themselves smashed. Well in a way this is a literary dream come true, I mean, the bloody underdogs played a great move and they deserved to win.  The legendary Trojans went on defence, closing the walls and even getting the attackers to come in and defend (think Ronaldo). The Greeks knew they had to pull something off to win it, they had to risk it... As in in the legendary story the horse was suspected, and if they went ahead and burnt up the horse Greek's hopes were all gone. But the Greeks went for the risk, and they pulled off the Trojan horse trick. This is bloody scary... I mean all the similarities...  Oh well, not really my usual length of posts...

It is such a straightforward recitation of our thoughts that even my mom conceded it was bloody boring. Why, why, why? Why didn't they just accept that laughter is always the best way to get through. Why did they not accept my script? Because they wanted it serious.   I tell you that if you're being judged by a panel that supposed to be open to all forms of presentation, that thing would have been so fine, but hello, in front of a larger audience, the one sure thing that will win all of them is their participation. What can induce them to participate? Clapping! What can make them clap? LAUGHTER! Next time something like this happens... Fuck it off, cause they're not going to listen to the truth anyway.

3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"09,August,2004","             Recently blogging has been all the trend, and on the papers it's been pretty publicised. Some blogs have been singled out as good and popular; some of which actually mean something, some of which don't. Today I was unfortunate enough to chance upon one that was a diary of a tormented and life of pure idiocrasy.  If you are bored and want to take a look into the blog, here's the address(http://xiaxue.blogspot.com). I don't know what so special about her blog, cause all I see is daily routine and well, Singapore propaganda. Oh yeah... There's it's own bit of vulgarity as well. At least here I'm refined enough to learn how to control my anger when there's nothing but a blank screen staring at me. How can any proper lady get so crude without any provoking factor? Maybe, in her definition, a 'Singapore Lady.'  Here it's entirely different isn't it? I hate Singapore, I bash Singapore, only because unlike her, I am a highly intelligent person who has prospects outside of Singapore. What's even worse is that she actually generalised people 'Coming from English-speaking girl and boy schools like ACS or MGS' as those who traditionally quit the country for better opportunities. I don't know what's her bloody problem, probably that she was never smart enough to get into these English speaking schools. She obviously can't see that people in these, by the way top schools, have enough foresight to recognise that honest and long-term success cannot be obtained by those who stay illogically loyal to their country.  From my point of view, even my dog makes more sense than her. I'm just hoping that this extreme will, like her blog, attract the masses, the intellectual masses...           "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"04,August,2004","             Drat it... I've been having problems with blogspot these few days, that's why my Amazing Race stuff is up so late. I couldn't log in properly, so I emailed the admin to find out whta's wrong. I don't know whether they did help me fix the problem, but anyway it's fixed now so I'm fine with it. Anyway I realised I'm not posting much about my regular life anymore, so since I'm free and not sleepy, I'll do that right now!  First let's start off with the tests. Quite a few tests back over the recent weeks, and I topped all of them! With a Bio and E Maths perfect, I'm invincible at the moment. At least since this week, that is... I had a E Maths test on Monday on a topic I haven't done with my tutor, and I know that I did really horribly. Then yesterday came the big blow, my English test came back and I crapped. I actually failed an English test. At one point in time I remembered being regarded as an English expert. And I failed my test, 21/50. Entirely depressing! I guess it put me in place, so now I've got to work even harder... I'm really starting to wonder how long more I can keep this up. I have a feeling I'm going to break soon.  Anyway for Biology that idiotic b!tch Kelvin Chen got 24/25. He's really scary, cause now he's pumped to try and knock me off my top spot. I hoped he got really discouraged by my beating him when I didn't even study the night before. I'm wondering how I can convey that to him. 'You're stupid... I didn't even need to study to get this one, and you worked so hard for a less than perfect score.' Any suggestions on how that message can get to him?  I went out with Mum and Dad today, and if I remember correctly I ate Shanghainese. My memory is horrible these days, need to think before I can remember what I ate a few hours ago. On the way there there was this old Caucasian man pushing his wife out of Gleneagles hospital. His wife seemed to be real sick and only had her ward robes on, and her flesh was poring out of it. I didn't mean to say she's fat, I just wanted to show how weak and helpless she looked. Anyway they seemed to be rushing to Tanglin Mall. I really don't know what was happening, but I kind of think she was pretty much ready to go, and her husband was granting her her last wish or something. It's scary to think that you might be in this position a couple of years down the road. That's probably one of the reasons why I don't want to get married. C.S Lewis once said, 'To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken.' I never want to fall in love.         "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"04,August,2004","             Yes, I told you that all the animal titles would be my comments on the teams. The sphinx can be counted as an animal right? Even though it has a human head. Argh.. Nevermind! Let’s get to it shall we?  Colin & Christie – With a display of great wit this leg, they have gained a 13 hour lead over the other teams. They, however, seem to lose it next leg as Charla & Mirna steal their cab. They really deserve for their cab to be stolen, after all that bickering this leg. Going to travel agencies seems to be what Colin does best, but always remember, when there’s a flight that’s going to go soon, and you cannot afford to waste time, it’s not always the best option. Colin has a really bad attitude, and instead of Christie bringing down the team, Colin will succumb easily under pressure. I thik they have what it takes to go far, most probably to the final 3 teams.  Charla & Mirna – I can’t make any excuses for their neglecting to check with the trusty travel agencies. Like I said before, the safer option is the airport. Their not being able to find a taxi was stupid, even though they did save a bit of cash there. Finding the 50 min earlier flight out was one of the best tactical maneuvers I’ve seen on this season so far. I kind of think if Colin & Christie had gotten the same tickets as everybody, they wouldn’t have performed as well as these 2, because they would’ve succumbed to “peer pressure” and went with the others to eat, drink and be merry. Mirna better start doing something for the team, cause now it isn’t exactly balanced. With 2 people o the team with an equal number of plus and minus points, balance is very important.  Brandon & Nicole – Funny how the expected Final 3 teams come in 1,2 and 3 this leg. Of all the spoiled final 3 teams, I think this one is the worst as they succumbed to “peer pressure” to fellowship with the other teams instead of trying to find better options. Getting Chip to help, was it a show of manipulative powers? I don’t know. Not much shown on this leg about them really…  Chip & Kim – Where was Kim? I don’t even recall her speaking in a confessional this time around. Chip seems to be the brains and brawn of this team, and Kim is just there to fulfill the ‘team’ requirement to get into the race. I kind of think that they need to start bickering a little bit to make more of an impact on the show. Chip surely went up in my ratings this week. Although helping people is not so much a good tactical maneuver, I’ve said it before that I’d rather someone play Mr. Nice Guy than good player. He better not help anyone if they get any further, cause he may just ‘help’ himself out of the race.  Marshall & Lance – All I remember of them was that Marshall’s leg was hurt. I don’t see how he got that injury, unless he was so dumb that he injured himself during the 12 hour break. Oh yeah… He is dumb! I really don’t know why they didn’t ask help from anyone for the Rock & Roll thing, since one of them was injured. They actually showed a little race skill by checking in with the Air France office. Unfortunately, it was closed. When a team is rumored to be eliminated next round, I don’t think it’s exactly viable to support them.  Kami & Karli – They really don’t seem to have any brains. You know that you’re more physical than the bowling moms, and when you don’t know where to go you might as well wait for them and then beat them at the Roadblock. It was risky for them to go walking around like that, without a clue as to where to go. If they weren’t helped out by Chip, I think they would be roaming the desert for 40 years.   Linda & Karen – Domestic airport mistake, again! These people never learn, do they? I’m just wondering how they’ll cope next week, because this week was all that was shown of them was mistake after accident, and mistake after accident. Again, the blonde one didn’t do anything, and what’s worse, now she has an excuse to let the other one do all the work. I was hoping they didn’t catch up to the 3.15pm flight to Cairo, because they really didn’t deserve to. Getting their money stripped of them was entirely deserving, but what would’ve been better is that they got eliminated.          "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"04,August,2004","             Anyone see dead mummies this episode. I sure did, but of course since the producers were not licensed to kill they had to almost kill them by stripping them of all their cash in Egypt. I mean, when you’re not going to be going to the airport, and you’re in a poor country like this, how in the world are you going to get money other than being a night soil carrier?  So, the teams left the pit stop in Catherine’s Palace, and found that they had to take a train to St. Petersburg’s Hermitage museum. There they had to find Rembrandt’s “Return of the Prodigal Son”, something that sounds vaguely familiar. I kind of think I chanced upon it while doing my OM research, because Rembrandt is one of the registered artists in the problem. So anyway Chip & Kim took an extraordinarily long time to find the painting, while Colin & Christie started a leg of bickering by suggesting that the Prodigal Son was Jesus. I’m left wondering whether God neglected to give him any sense of general knowledge. In the meantime, Charla & Mirna, unlike all other teams who took cabs, “choo-chooed” their way to the train station on foot. A great display of Race skills was shown when she asked locals about the painting.         Once the teams found their painting, they found that they had to go to Cairo, Egypt, for this leg of the race. Chip & Kim stupidly rushed to the airport, while Colin & Christie, a pair that has proven to be apt at flight arrangements, walked to a travel agency. A travel agency is the place where they actually check all the airlines for the earliest flight. In airports, their access to flight information is limited, and most of the staff are too lazy to check thoroughly.  Kami & Karli were the only other team smart enough to go to a travel agency, but they were too late to catch Colin & Christie’s flight.  Colin & Christie came to the realization that they were on the earliest flight to Egypt, and the others had been duped by the Lufthansa lady. They had a stopover in Paris, for quite a number of hours, I presume, since they had time to find another flight. This flight, instead of 2.25pm, landed at 2.35 am, about 12 hours earlier than expected. They got to Egypt and the Tower of Cairo, but found it closed. The poor things had to sleep in the Egyptian streets. I mean, even the poor Egyptians don’t sleep on the streets, and they had to?!  All the other teams stopped over at Frankfurt, except Linda & Karen. They were found to be with the lying Lufthansa lady, who informed them it was possible to catch up in Frankfurt. She turned out not to be lying for a second time around, cause they really caught up. Meanwhile, in Frankfurt, cousins Charla & Mirna proved that they were too small to be noticed when they isolated themselves from the other teams to find better tickets out. It turns out that there was a better flight, and our little pink panthers, complete with the tiptoeing scene, left for the flight that landed 50 minutes earlier than the other. That scene, coupled with Lance stirring in his piggy-wiggy slumber, was one of the most hilarious scenes in TAR history.  In Cairo, Colin & Christie went up to the tower to find one of 2 “Fast Forwards” in the whole race. In a way it was a good option because there are only 2, and the likelihood of you using either would be pretty small. Might as well take a rest from 1 leg of the race. They had to carry this sarcophagus, one of those gold coffin thingys in the pyramids that you usually see in the movies, from somewhere to a temple. Colin was being a huge jerk by thinking he was so smart and not heeding Christie’s advice. In the end, Christie was right and they carried the thing to the temple. At the temple, Christie refused to shut her gap and wanted Colin to admit he was wrong. Bad move! I should know since my father’s a Colin (same name, same character…). When they reached the temple, Colin halted and started bickering. The priest started shaking his head in disapproval… Hey! These clue holders aren’t supposed to display emotion! Well anyway, I was hoping the priest tear up the clue in objection to their quarrelling in his temple, but he didn’t and sent Colin & Christie along to their pit stop, The Sphinx.         Colin & Christie arrived at the pit stop at 11.27am, and I have to fast forward 3 hours to when Charla & Mirna arrive. They go to the Tower of Cairo, and found that they had to go to the Giza plateau and follow the yellow rocks to their next clue. They went there, had a little trouble, and then finally got themselves to the Roadblock. From what I see, this was the most time consuming thing in this leg. It might have taken even longer than the Detour!         The Roadblock: one team member had to enter Osiris’ shaft and grab a artifact bag. Citing claustrophobia, Mirna asked Charla to go down. I’m left wondering what Mirna can do besides getting her team noticed at ticketing counters. Poor little Charla had to climb every single rung of the ladder because of her “littleness”, and after a while, with the bag as big as she was, she had to take little rests on the ladders. Those producers sure aren’t thinking too much about her still being in the race…         Anyway, Charla & Mirna were given a map as their next clue, coupled with the contents in the bag. Puzzling for a little while, they assembled the puzzle on the map and found the little hole that led them to their next location. They found the Detour as other teams started arriving at the Roadblock. Kami & Karli, however, were easily dumfounded by the puzzle. Not like they realize that the oval room in the white house doesn’t have corners…         The Detour this time involved Rock & Roll, and Hump & Ride. In Rock & roll, nice play on words to the producers, teams had to use an ancient method of transporting wooden blocks. Ball bearings in the form of logs were given beneath the stones and teams had to roll it, apparently across the length of a football field. It is, according to Phil, “physically demanding, but if you master the ancient art of rolling stones, it can be completed quickly.”         In Hump & Ride, which only Charla & Mirna arrived in time for, teams has to get on horses to guide camels with carpets on their bags to a carpet merchant. This task was entirely up to the moods of the horses, whether they went fast or not. I have a feeling with all those empathetic horse and camel rearers by Charla’s side, even helping her to get on the horse, they managed this task pretty fast.         And all the teams went to the pit stop, where the moms got last place. It isn’t a big surprise as there’s a Fast Forward. The producers wouldn’t want the Fast Forward to determine who gets eliminated, especially since they’re trying to downplay and eliminate the Fast Forwards. Anyway next week the mummies have to beg. Will they be wrapped up and sent into the tomb? I don’t think they would fit into one of those sarcophagus thingys!          "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"04,August,2004","             Wow! Ok... So today I got caught in ths thing that was shockingly similar to the 'Don't talk to me!' from Lance last episode of the Amazing Race. As you all know, the one person I really can't stand in class is Kelvin Chen. With his whiny voice and incessant speaking when spoken, or even not spoken to, I have about this much tolerance left for him.  Well, I don't know if he's under the impression that we're actually on good terms, cause he actually dared ask me for help. During recess, I was casually walking to my seat when he cut right in front of me and went 'Have you seen Liwei?' Really like Lance, cause I don't think he was expecting the person he hated most to talk to him. I honestly thought that 'Don't talk to me!' was going to come out of my mouth, but instead, I just stood there for a moment and then shrugged. Ahah... That just proves that the 'Don't talk to me!' was uncalled for! Boo to Marshall & Lance, who are rumoured to go next week. Thank everything on and off the earth should that happen!  Anyway why he asked for Liwei was because the estate office found out about the key. What happened was that the smartest boy in the class, Liwei, was handed the key on Friday to open the door back from the lab. He did the stupidest thing by throwing the key around and it eventually landed in the gap behing the whiteboard. Now it can't come out. Oh the irony that the smartest boy in class would do the most stupid thing! Anyway for a moment he thought he was doomed but 'Oh my Saviour!' Kelvin turned out a duplicate key. Supposedly he was afraid something like that would happen and took the key for duplication, complete with yellow tag and class printed. He managed to dodge the estate for the weekend but yesterday someone returned late and the estate man took a look at the key knew it was a duplicate.  Ahh... Control freak Kelvin gets into trouble for trying to handle too many things at once. Another person's in charge of the key, but he, with his OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) about trying to be all responsible and running the class, has taken over since the start of the year. How much you want to bet he'll push the blame?  Oh yeah, more on class happenings... Toh Siew Tee, my Bio teacher stopped me after class today and told me I got full marks for the test. And she was giving me this toothy grin that reminded me of Dobby the House Elf. To think Kelvin Chen was actually trying to surprise me by studying and attempting to hit me off the Bio topspot! LOSER! I just have a feeling that the 'Don't talk to me!' is going to come out of my mouth very, very soon...         "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"02,August,2004","             By  Ethan Alter   There's one thing you can say for sure about Bob and Joyce: These senior citizens definitely don't look like your typical Internet-dating couple. Still, the latest team to face Philimination on CBS's The Amazing Race (Tuesdays, 10pm/ET) was also one of the most popular thanks to their upbeat attitudes, strong racing skills and all-around good-heartedness. Here the New Jersey natives reminisce about their first date, and look ahead to the future.    Ethan: So tell us the story of how you met.    Joyce:  We met through Match.com. I had been a widow for a long time and didn't have much of a personal life. I was raising my three children and working hard. My son, who is a software engineer, told me, 'Mom, you need a life. Go on the Internet. It's the only way you'll be able to do this.' And I said, 'No way.' But he insisted and helped me put my profile on Match.com. Lo and behold, Bob came on...   Bob:  And I saw her profile. Actually, I passed over it several times because she looked like a girly girl and I was looking for someone who liked outdoor things. But one day, I read her profile and it said she likes outdoor activities. So I sent her an e-mail and the rest is history.   Joyce:  For our first date, we had drinks at a local restaurant. Afterwards, Bob walked me to my car and when I got in, I thought, 'Yes!'   Bob:  I got back home that night and my daughter walked in. She knew I had had several dates on the Internet and so she asked, 'Well, how'd this one go?' And I said, 'This one went really well.'   Joyce:  We knew immediately that this was going to be a long-term thing. The race just sealed it.   Ethan: Whose idea was it to apply for TAR?    Bob:  [Raising his hand] I was a fan of the show and, actually, I was already planning to do it with my brother-in-law. My hook was 'Meet two brothers-in-law who actually get along.' But then, I met Joyce and thought, 'This will be a lot more fun.' I knew she would go along with the application and I knew we were going to get picked. Two widowed people who met on the Internet and are active — we've got a few things going. Joyce didn't think so. Then we were picked.   Joyce:  And I was like, 'I really have to do this now! What in the world did I get myself in to?' But I would do it again in a heartbeat, as long as I didn't have to eat any more caviar!   Ethan: Yeah, that caviar challenge looked positively brutal.    Joyce:  It was awful! We had already decided that I was going to do all the eating challenges because I eat virtually anything, and I do love caviar. But when I saw the amount of caviar, I was shocked! When I first started eating it, I was like, 'Okay, this is gross, but I can eat it.' But after a while you felt like you just had to throw up.   Ethan: Since you're both so Internet savvy, are you thinking of putting up your own website after the show is over?    Bob:  I don't know. It would be nice to hear 'Hey Bob and Joyce, I took your advice and I met someone.' That's part of our story. We hope we can encourage people to take a chance and get out there and try again. Maybe they can be as lucky as we were.   Joyce:  I would like to do that, if only to give people like us a means of support. If you are widowed or divorced, it doesn't make a difference how old you are. Put yourself out there. Take a chance. Every day is another experience. I tell my children this all the time: 'Do something every day that scares you and you always will remain fresh.' Bob laughed at me when I first told him that.   Bob:  I had heard to do something that scares you every once in a while, not every day.   Joyce:  Every day!   Ethan: Knowing what you know now, what would you do differently if you ran the race over again?    Bob:  We'd probably try to work with the other teams a little bit more. Also, don't always believe the information you're given. Double-check and triple-check everything.   Joyce:  Definitely stay connected to the other teams more; you never know what you can pick up. And the teams that are racing are very smart. It's so nice to see young people with so much intuition and the absolute moxie to put themselves out there and work it.   Bob: Overall, we're happy with the way we ran the race. We didn't want to screw anybody over or embarrass our children or ourselves. We knew we had a life to come back to after this — that was always in the back of our minds. We felt real good about doing the race the way we wanted to do it. And I think we had more fun than most people!   Joyce:  Because of this experience, Bob and I are going to backpack in Greece next year. You can go anywhere in this world — you don't need a tour and you don't need luggage. You can carry everything you need on your back.   Ethan: So now that you've survived the race together, have you taken the next step?    Bob:  We're not engaged yet, but we're confident that we have met the partner we want to spend the rest of our lives with. We're taking it a day at a time. This is real.   Joyce:  This is for real. We'll be together. He knows that and I know that about him. What will follow will follow, and we'll just take each day as it comes. I always said I don't need $1 million, because $1 million is fleeting. I got the biggest prize of all: I got Bob. It sounds corny, but it's true.           "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"01,August,2004","             Can you believe it? I actually went to Geylang yesterday, cause my dad wanted to try something new and there was like the supposed food haven. It was really an experience for me, cause I kept thinking of Amazing Race possibilities. Now who said Amazing Race could never come back here cause there's nothing left to do?  We were kind of stuck trying to find an illegal carpark somewhere along the street, cause there was no friggin space. My mom was wondering why people were starting to wear Red Shirts so early, something that I really laughed hard at. It's not like Christmas which starts early at November, mom! Apparently the prospect of National Day parade preview had never occured to her. Those cheap Singaporeans are out only for the freebies, who cares which day you go on?   Ok... Enough with the Singapore bashing, which will cease for the moment cause everyone that's feeling so patriotic will kill me. We went to this apparently famous for seafood restaurant, where there seemed to be some gravy left on the 'cleaned' table by a very generous previous patron. I sat as far away from the table as I possibly could without looking too snobbish. My usual elbows on the table were drawn uncomfortably to myself. I drank the tea, which had some black dust inside. I couldn't help but to wonder whether it was cigarette dust or tea leaf residue. Unrealistic me... What are the chances of it being the former compared to the latter right? I don't even want to think about it.  The food was pretty good, but I much rather have stayed in the comforts of my home and da-paoed something from the Cze Cha just down the road. It apparently also got 5/6 chopsticks from Makansutra, which was the same as the restaurant we just went to. Anyway we got some of the famous Tanjong Rhu Pao and went back to our car. On the way back, we had to cross an overhead bridge. One half of the stairs leading up was occupied by creepy Indian men, and they all seemed so coordinated, sitting on one side. It was like in that childhood story, with the scary beast under the bridge that threatened to eat up anyone who tried to cross. We opted to brave the never ceasing current of cars instead.  There seemed to be some soliciting going on, right next to our car! The Indian man then proceeded to convieniently lean on our car when we were just a few metres away. I couldn't help but to pass a comment to my Dad saying, 'Dad, there's a pimp on your car!' The Indian Man pulled away, and they carried their dealings somewhere else. I can't imagine how many deals my car must have seen through the night. Anyway, that's all for my experience in Geylang! I still have some paos left!         "
3359005,male,14,Student,Scorpio,"01,August,2004","             If you ever see a random title, it's my opinions of the teams on each leg of the race. And it's starting to take form; the first one was Skrewts, a creature from Harry Potter. Now it's weasel. So if you just understood whatever the hell I just said, cheers for you. Here's the stuff!  Chip & Kim – The number one placing is very much undeserved. They have shown before that they are incapable of making flight arrangements. This week, they got lucky because Colin went all out to help everyone but Mirna. The thing is, you can’t depend on someone every leg, and you won’t be number one on the finishing line just because you can eat caviar.  Colin & Christie – I think they are one of the most strategic players to ever be in this game. They, along with Brandon & Nicole, see Charla & Mirna as threats and decided it would be best to try and bring them down. I really don’t like Colin’s dirty play, but it’s a really smart strategic move to try and get Charla & Mirna out early. Really, really bad choice getting a girl to eat when there’s a guy in the team. Guys are always stronger at these eating things… Just look at Fear Factor! Christie’s emerging as really bitchy. I know you’re all frustrated at having to eat salt, but no need to take it out on your boyfriend and another team!  Marshall & Lance – Same thing as Chip & Kim. These two got lucky with Colin playing dirty. You’re just pawns in his game, so watch out. I thought the “Don’t talk to me!” comment at the bus station when Mirna tried to ask you a question was really uncalled for. I mean, Mirna was actually trying to be nice and you told her to shut her trap. As the only other guy to have eaten the caviar, you really let your team down by doing it so much slower than Chip. I love it when you declared to everyone when they asked whether placings were still being respected, shows that you’re actually thinking of ways to get ahead. From then on, you just rode the “Colin help” wagon. According to the spoilers which have been accurate so far, these two go next week… Let’s continue hoping!  Charla & Mirna – Rock on gals! These two looked to be in huge trouble this time, but they managed to save themselves again. They have proved that they can survive independently, without any alliances and without any help from others. I really respect them for that, but a few friends won’t do any harm. Mirna is getting on my nerves, but I like Charla too much to make this team budge from my number one spot. As I said in my summary, I don’t know if they had secured on the connecting flight through Germany or just got lucky. If they indeed secured the Germany connecting flight, they’re the flight supremos this season. The editors very unhelpfully forgot to tell us when the Swiss Air flight would arrive compared to Colin & Christie’s flight. The editors might be trying to downplay them, lest they stick out as the winners this season because of their superior flight arranging skills.  Brandon & Nicole – I hate their strategy so badly, and it doesn’t seem to work. They make alliances that they know they will not keep, and benefit without benefiting others. I also hate the way that they keep proclaiming to be Christians. Christie said something to the effect of them being Christian, but they will be ruthless when it comes to competition. Something about playing well. It’s like saying “I’m Christian, but I will not hesitate to lie, cheat and steal…” What a hypocrite! Brandon, they one doing all the lying to alliances, states that he wants to live as an example to others, so won’t drink the vodka. So your living example would be to backstab whenever necessary? Stop contradicting yourselves, and stop reminding us you’re Christian! The fact that we know you’re Christian, and yet see you backstab people week after week is enough!  Linda & Karen – Queerly, we didn’t see much of them this episode. Maybe they’re not as interesting as I initially thought they were. I actually thought they are the female versions of Ken & Gerard, but now it doesn’t seem so much like it. They don’t have much skills in finding flights. I mean, Charla & Mirna jumped right to the front again with their skills, but you couldn’t? You’re losing your entertainment value in this season, and you’re not a very proficient team at the race. Your leaving would make more space for the more interesting teams to show!  Kami & Karli – Second to last, again? This teams physical capabilities has pulled them through so far, but their lack of brains will pull them down eventually. I really can’t say much about this team, cause they haven’t really been featured much. I admire the fact that they one doing the Roadblock was shivering when she was done. It was a much better reaction than giving up and sleeping like the other prom queens. Sheer grit and determination is what got her through. The comment about “We hate getting pushed back already” was a redundant statement. If you don’t like getting pushed back, do something about it…  Bob & Joyce – Awww… Last week I said that I was beginning to see why my friend liked them so much., and this week they are eliminated. I did say that they weren’t showing much character and will need to go if they stay this boring, but I didn’t mean this soon! Joyce ate the caviar fast, and she can be counted as a prom queen cause she’s a skinny female. She didn’t even flinch! We didn’t exactly see Joyce finish the caviar, so I kind of think the producers were kind enough to tell her that they’d already been eliminated. Bob’s words to her on the horse carriage sounded as if she was on her deathbed traveling around the world… Err… I don’t think I should be so mean to such a loving couple. I sincerely wish them good luck on their relationship, cause they look like they’re going to be a real happy couple together.          "
2012853,female,23,indUnk,Libra,"30,October,2003","       Famous people are weird aren't they?? Its like they're not real people. I just went to the Craig David concert and the show was good (not as good as Prince mind you but I like Craig David better, and yes I went to that one twice on the weekend.)  The show was good, he was good, the seats were excellent!!..  It was all in all a good night... There was some trash on parade though, the outfits of some of the people were shocking!! Not to mention the ages, there was heaps of young girls and older people too. He reaches all people.. which is cool...  Anyway, what I was trying to say is that I think fame is a weird concept. We waited after the concert to see Craig David come out of the backstage door and after a long wait he eventually did. It was very weird to see him in person, in full view and in a normal setting, walking around, getting into a car.   And it must be weird for him that there were hundreds of people waiting for that..,.... I don't know what I'd be like if there were fans waiting for me to come out of my house every day or to go shopping, even for groceries..   I guess we take stuff like that for granted.. I don't know how he lives but it must be well even though it would be lonely..   And all those fans, wanting to know things about you, everything, to see you and hear you.. theres a bitter irony to it all...  but i guess i'll never know because I am not waiting to be famous, i only know what its like to wait to see somebody famous..   Prince was also a strange thing to see. We could see his face better as he had big screens and it was also surreal.. The show was much more 80s and funky, and the band was great.. Also, Prince ended up being on for 2 and 1/2 hours but Craig David was only on for 1 and 15 I think.. but he has less songs.  At Prince  everyone danced ... at this one, the fans were too reserved and only a percentage of the crowd stood up..   For the Prince concert I went because my boyfriend had a ticket that a friend had bailed on but we still had a good time.. he enjoyed it so much and I liked seeing him having fun, dancing and singing. That was on last friday night, the 24th.  Then the next night the 25th I worked at it and went in after with friends. It was less packed and had less of a party vibe.. so I was definitely glad that i went the first night..   So now am relaxed but had a big day, i'll write more later when I have the time..

2012853,female,23,indUnk,Libra,"21,October,2003","       Phew!!!  what a day./.....   Its week 12 at uni this week, so I am trying to organise 12 weeks worth of notes for 3 subjects and do all the reading, questions and learning..  Today wasn't bad considering it is my least favourite day. Something good happened for a change, which was good and has given me renewed confidence in myself.   It started yesterday though, when I got back an assignment I had worked hard on . The mark on the paper was 55. My tutor said she wanted to see me and said that it was one of the best reports she had read, and that it was well written and argued.   I thought to myself, 'am i hearing this right?'.. and told her I wasn't happy and that I wanted something to happen. I asked her if i could re do the assignment and she said she;d ask ...   so needless to say I was pretty fired up yesterday afternoon. ...  whilst on this fired up trippy thing i wrote email to the lecturer and course coordinator requesting to see him to talk about it..  long story short I went today and got him to read it and it was remarked too.. got 70!!!  I almost fell off my seat!!   The moral of the story is that if you know yourself, then no one can tell you otherwise. I knew I was capable of more than a 55  - I usually get average marks like 70 and in this case I knew it was worth about that...   Hehehe... what a day!   ;P         "
2012853,female,23,indUnk,Libra,"19,October,2003","       Just in case anyone is wondering.. (no one probably reads this anyway but to put my mind at ease)..  I didn't end up going out on the day of my birthday (which I said I was in my last blog before todays bloggs.) Because none of my friends could make it  - I ended up going out with my boyfriend and we saw Lara Croft Tombraider and ate Vietnamese in George st .. it was a nice date, and funny cause earlier on in the day a work friend had presented me with this huge buinch of flowers, the most beautiful, romantic flowers ever, two bunches of light and dark pink tiger striped lilys with green leafy stalks.. (shes a close girlfriend too) and wherever we went that night all the women everywhere would look at the flowers, drool and sigh and then look at my boyfriend as if he was the most lovely guy ever!!! Hehehe it was funny!!!     There was one point in the evening when I had to go to the bathroom after the movie and left boyfriend holding the flowers outside the toilets, and this girl approached him when I was inside, and gushed over the flowers and him!!! Heheh.....   But last night was a nice surprise.. it was about a week since the actual birthday, and last night went to the pub with school friends, as my friends from work couldn't make it..   But they surprised me and turned up and it was great!! They are the best, and the presents they got me are so nice I love them..   So thats how my birthday panned out..

Went out for my birthday last night with friends from school and ended up at this break beat dj's set afterward... didn't get home til about 4am and woke up at 9ish...  They asked me what I wanted for my birthday and they got me 2 cds (which i requested) and this make up bag thing too for my pending trip overseas at the end of the year. Its pretty cool - its a surf brand one. But its just not really my style. But it is the thought that counts..  though.   I was supposed to clean my room and study today but as you can imagine i am sleep deprived and lying around falling asleep everywhere..   Its been a busy week..i got a lot done - i got my haircut and my nails done too so i feel pretty special..  also went to gym twice, worked two days and attended all classes, tutorials, and had my final commerce presentation ever... and handed in a 3000pg group report..  yay!!   going to rest now... @_@ i feel like a zombie... >.

I don't really want to be older, I want to stay as I am, because I know that I am unprepared.. Coinciding with my birthday is the return of Uni and I know that it will be busy.   There's so much going on in my life right now that sometimes I feel like i can't breathe...  I went to the John Mayer concert on the weekend and in amongst the crowd (it was a sold out event) it was strange that I experienced the physicality of what emotionally and spiritually I have been feeling for awhile.   I felt cramped in, hot, like my skin couldn't breathe, and just weary overall..   But it was the best concert I have been to to date.... entirely worth it..           "

2012853,female,23,indUnk,Libra,"29,February,2004","       If anyone is wondering, when I say ' there ', I mean that place that you thought you would be in when you were little and wanted to be grown up.  But do you ever get  there ? and what  is it ? Is it finishing high school? finishing Uni? Getting into a relationship?  I'm 23 and I always thought my life would be different to what it is now. I always thought I would have done so much by now, yet sometimes I feel like I've done nothing. I'm not there yet.. when will i get there?  When I was away, in KL, my cous said a funny thing. She was talking about her future (she has youth on her side) and all the things she would have acheived by the time she was 25. A house, a car, a high paying job. I laughed at her, and told her what the world really was like, that I was 23 going on 24 and had no house, a junky car and two lowly paying jobs, and no chance of getting them by the time I hit 25. She looked at me in disbelief as if I was lying to her, and I didn't know what to say. They were so important to her, I guess that was her 'it', her getting 'there' was 'it'.   I know that those things aren't important, maybe if I had them already I would think so, but I would rather not have them and enjoy life as it is for now than wish for something that is far away in the future.  I am dying to get away from this place, and see the world. More than just asia, I'd like to travel to Europe, Africa and America, to see what its like there. here, especially where my parents live, its a suburban existence. I go to the local malls and feel out of place because I don't have a pram with babies in it. Two friends of mine got married last year and that scares me so much. Lots of other people have asked me why, but to me its crystal clear - marriage is cutting yourself off from discovering things in this world, and entering into the 'suburban' part of your life. when you're married there's more than just you, and you sort of disappear into that.  For me, at this stage, I think thats 'it'; not getting caught up in the suburban existence; i'd rather be doing something life changing, for myself, that  I  want. Before that (suburban existence- husband, house and kids) I want to be a traveller and have my own experiences and discoveries, away from everything that is here and that I have always been used to..... and thats  it !!!

2012853,female,23,indUnk,Libra,"09,February,2004","       HiHi! Basically, I have to write something because I have been soooo darned lazy these past few months and my friend emailed me to say she'd be checking (how boring, Sorry Charmaine!)  She just told me she wouldn't be back for another 18 months, which I suspected because I think that London might be a little like KL, it sounds really fun and a lot of people that go there spend a longer time there than they thought they would.. my unlce spent 12 yrs there and he was supposed to study only!!  Plus its good money and travel prospects everything being so close and all. So this is essential to our keeping in touch..   The last few months, ok three (? i think) have gone past very quickly. I've been away from Sydney and my life here for 9 weeks and  it felt so  goood ...  I love travelling and seeing new things. Coming back has been a little hard actually, because it means i have to do things and get back 'on the ball'... just litle things, like the pile of mail, were hard to deal with, i open it, look at it, then put it back down.. have become really lazy and non correspondive (i know its not a word but ya know).. but the good news is that things are happening slowly. I have cleaned out my wardrobe and am proud to say I am up to date!! I threw away so much stuff I was ruthless!!  On the return journey I got sick, and got a cold so thats also why i haven't been doing anything, - the cold got pretty bad and i just lay in bed for a couple of days with jet lag and the fluey cold feeling of fuzziness.. then it turned into a bronchial cough, which i still have at times...   But about KL, I love it. Thats where I went and spent my time, with my family (aunties and cousins and uncles..) ..The shopping is awesome, and the food is also great. Its like they are more on par with America in some ways - just the franchise chain stores they have there are really American, like hot dogs, pretzels (we have those here i know) and others (they had this one where you could get a pizza flavoured crepe or banana peanut butter crepe all folded over and it was great! really crispy!)  Also the supermarkets are huge!! and the mallssssssss!!   But the funny thing is my cousins seem to be at that age (puberty  - all between 10-20) where they think they are doing everything right but they are really just being strange and silly! And Jay and I saw straight through them - don't know if its about the down to earthness of Australia or just my family..  Being back is a little tiring, cause I know that its back to the daily grind, wish I could escape and run away!!  Haven't worked much at all, both my workplaces seem to not have any work - its quite at TT and DM has already rostered everything up until March-  so have been trying to fill the 3 days i have off per week this session. By chance, got a  job interview  tomorrow with the firm my cousin is presently working for, so feeling abit nervous about it. Its a law firm so I am not exactly feeling confident.. and uni is finishing soon (6 mths) and then who knows?!... its just for more rounded work experience than customer service is all. Gotta try it...Can only try..   Anyway, thats all for now, sorry its so boring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Hehehehe catch up more soon...             "
2012853,female,23,indUnk,Libra,"01,March,2004","       Does this count as a hobby?   I have decided, that I am going to become a person who has many hobbies. I've been feeling a little 2-D lately, partly cause a new friend asked me if I had an online journal, and i thought I did but after visiting his mine seems so.. well, 2D. I don't know if I want to show this to him.... his site was pretty good, it had all the interests and recent things that had happened to him.. and it got me thinking, what are my interests? what are my hobbies? I guess I just never thought about it before.  That may sound sad,  but when I asked my brother if he thought I had any hobbies, he flatly replied,  'your hobbies are friends and work'.  ahem.  Boring!! There's so much to me than that! Isn't there?  Music, concerts, Books, Games, AND friends and work i guess.  Well i guess going to concerts was a bit of a habit last year, and i'm sure it will be too this year. Last year I saw Groove Armada, John Mayer, Michelle Branch and (not really my choice but circumstancial attendance)  Prince, Shaggy and Craig David.  I guess thats somewhat attached to work though, so does that make it a hobby still??   And i went to tropfest last week, which was excellent!! it was a big thing in the domain where they showed short films and everyone brought picnics with wine, cheese, and other miscellaneous picnic food. It was great, lounging around watching the short films.. great stuff.  So I guess I do have hobbies,  and interests, just don't have a site about it.            "
2012853,female,23,indUnk,Libra,"19,April,2004","       I had a great weekend. Bianca is back from Moree and there are lots of social activities happening! Drinks Friday night, got very trashed and sent out some drunkend sms and took P & D (formerly P & T, who is still a little upset) to meet my friend Peter at his work. I was a little trashed, on the way home ate 3 burgers (thats so gross) and so began a bad spell of late night eating binges. Stayed over in the city, went home the next day and that night went to the John Mayer concert at the Entertainment Centre.. it was the best thing ever! I love John Mayer, and so do alot of other girls and women..   But the lyrics, they are the best.. and I wish I had written down his set so i could remember it better, I was so scared I'd forget about it when I was watching him. We had excellent seats, mine was directly in front of him, first elevation entertainment centre.  Awesome Awesome... i bought the live CD any given thursday, and a sticker for my brother... A friend of mine surprised me with a ticket it was so lovely..  but we went for supper after (bad) and had korean (which was good) but I didn't get home till about 2, then had to get up to work at brookvale the next day.. (tiring)..   I have been floating around with a sea of John Mayer lyrics in my head all day.. and was all weekend..    'If only my life was more like 1983'     Whatever happened to my Whatever happened to my Whatever happened to my lunchbox? When came the day that it got  thrown away and don't you think i should have had some say  in that decision.........    He also talked quite a bit.. i really like him, he has a funny sense of humor and this way about him that is familiar.. He was doing an impersonation of his mother it was so funny.. you can tell that he's really clever and witty... quite taken with that.. want to go to New York to see the city he lives in, if it has the same vibe.. and want to try to explore some  more music.. jazz especially.. *sigh*...

2012853,female,23,indUnk,Libra,"13,April,2004","       Wow.. Time has flown, I have done so many things in the past few weeks don't know where to start. Well, I got the job at the law firm, and am there 3 days part time helping them out answering phones and photocopying, filing etc.. mail run in the afternoons after lunch.. its easy work sometimes hectic and the ladies are really nice (its actually an all female office, and one man). They are all Malaysian Chinese which is funny cause I have never worked in that kind of environment, but only had dinner parties family things in that type of environment. Lorraine one of the solicitors brought in curry puffs the other day and they were so nice! And Florence is from HK, she is always going for milk tea and they always buy me one!  But have been really tired the past week cause Ticketek has been pretty busy. Poor Dave I have been no picnic this week.. Last weekend I worked all weekend and this weekend I also worked, the Easter show is on at the moment and its been pretty hectic, I have been supervising lately so its a bit nerve wracking having people actually look to you for advice all the time.   But today I went out with Brian, Deepa, Katie and Carol (Brians flatmates). They are so funny and Carol had never seen the Opera house or Harbour Bridge so I made us go there - she liked it. We had dinner at Darling Harbour and also had yum cha at Chinatown in the morning.. The thing is, they spoke Mandarin alot and it was a litte confusing, I felt so left out and can't imaging how Deepa felt, I actually had to interrupt them and ask them what they were speaking about at dinner tonight. I felt so rude but they shouldn't have been speaking in front of us like that, especially with Deepa there. The fact that she came is quite refreshing, that she is willing to make contact like that and go out of her comfort zone to hang out with me was so endearing. Shes such a sweetheart.   Bee's back from Moree, and its so good to see her again. We went to the Easter show yesterday and it was sooo much fun. Me and Dave and Annie and Bee went on the ferris wheel and Annie was so scared she was clinging to the sides and doing deep breaths with a whhoooaaahh!!! whooaaahh!! and screaming!! hehe she is great fun.. We got our faces painted - I got a butterfly, bee her's painted like a fairy/showgirl and Annie got her's as a cat, pink to match her jumper, complete with black kitten nose with a splotch of glitter. So cool.. Ppl kept looking at us like we were strange but then smiling to themselves.. i think secretly they wanted to also but didn't have the guts..   Going to sleep now, on a last note we saw this alpaca yesterday and it was so dead to the world sleeping that it was sitting down but had its head flat on the floor in the hay, conked out.. it looked so funny.. i wish i had taken a snap.. thats what i feel like doing for the next 9 hours..

2012853,female,23,indUnk,Libra,"07,April,2004","       Hehe regarding online journals, I was speaking to my cous online last weerk and we were talking about online posting and journalling.. The reason why I thought my site wasn't up to scratch is - there's layers ... outer and inner.. And this is my inner journal, not an outer.. I should have realised by the glib, trendy-ness of that guys journal (who i secretly think is now a bit of wanker anyways) that it was an outer, or 'public' journal as my cousin put it....  and who has time to make a cool trendy journal for ppl to look at and say, 'hey, cool journal'!??          "
2012853,female,23,indUnk,Libra,"16,May,2004","       *Sigh* Not a good way to start a post i know, but its how I'm feeling right now..  The interview this week (i can't believe it was only this week, feels like forever - its sunday night and it was only 5 days ago) was well, it was a little odd to be honest. The first round was easy, I knew that I was doing well, but this second round, truthfully I don't think I was that impressive.   I arrived at the place a little early and like last time, was surprised to find that there were others there that had been there since the morning.. (another batch of recruits).. why am I always surprised?? I have no idea..   I am so naive like that.. They made us go into this small room, and sit at tables and prepare an individual case study. Mine was about car heaters and the production line, and at first I had no idea what to do. I read it a couple of times to get the info into my head since it was swimming from the excitement.  Then, as soon as it was done, they made us wait before we were taken away to do interviews...   There were three people that interviewed me - Wayne, Barry and a lady whose name I can't remember.  I did my presentation and felt stupid doing it to be honest, since it only went for about 8 mins, we talked about the problem and how to fix it. and then about other things also.   They asked me what my best subject was a uni - wasn't quite prepared, said strategic management. I should have said Business in Europe but i thought strategic mgmt sounded better.  it was still a D  - and worst - chemistry.  andyway, i felt a bit naive, i'm this thing that hasn't been out of uni or had a real job and i'm speaking to these ppl that have worked with the company for almost 20 years, and the lady 7 months. she commuted and said she was getting tired. said alot of ppl did it, which is reassuring.  The rest of my week was a real blur. Wednesday I had lunch with Justin, and it was fine, we have always gotten on well. But then on Thursday I was with Dave and we bumped into Justin and he looked sort of surprised, and he hasn't emailed me since ( I had sent him an email wed night).. he was with a girl, a pretty little girl, and they looked pretty uncomfortable. Which was weird. I am not sure how I feel about it really, I felt a bit down really but thats silly cause he knew new I had a boyfriend (as did I, duh!), it wasn't a secret.... sigh,... i don't know.. all i know is that sometimes there are ppl you've always been drawn to and i just don't want the progression  of our friendship to change now that he's met my boyfriend.. he could have just been really busy and not had time to email.. But i don't know whether or not to contact him or wait till he contacts me.   Thursday night i stayed up til 2 writing my assignment presentation which is tomorrow.   ARGHHH!! My LAST presentation for uni!!! YAY!!  Dave's bday was on Friday and i met him for a drink with his work friends. They are nice, very Australian. Then Dave and I went for dinner at Wagamamas and we got lots of little side dishes.. came home to his place, he fell asleep (cause he had had so many beers), and I went home..   We are getting along a lot better now, we were fighting a lot (or I was) for the last couple of months, somehow he was really annoying me by just being himself.. I am not sure if thats ever happened to anyone else thought assume it has. Although I was feeling a little down this week, I am not sure why. He has been very patient and understanding through it all, even though I was horrible..   I bought him towels and a bathmat for his bathroom. He chose them he's getting quite good at it really. They're really nice, his little apt. is very coordinated and relaxing to be at.. Last night we went out with his parents, they're up from Vic and it was like old times. They sure can drink though.... After we saw them last night I was trying to teach Dave some Canto phrases. He's not bad, but its so weird hearing him say things!! But i like it.   THats all I have to babble on about this week..   Tomorrow starts another cycle.. it never ends.   week 12 at uni only about 3 more till the end.   sigh...    Chaz, if your reading this, hope you're doing well babe.             "
2012853,female,23,indUnk,Libra,"08,May,2004","       Yep, thats right, I'm invited back!! Yahoo!! I have to go back on tuesday, and do a presentation to the line managers. Here's the paragraph from the email:   Congratulations you have been successful in moving through to the second round of the Masterfoods Australia/NZ Graduate Recruitment process, which will be held on the week commencing Monday 10th of May.   We will require three hours of your time, on the day highlighted below.  In the first two hours you will prepare a case study to present to Masterfoods Line Managers, followed by a half hour presentation of this case study.  Finally we will require you for an interview to commence immediately after the conclusion of your presentation.   Its a bit daunting! But so exciting! I'm ready!!   In other news, nothing much else is happening, except that I clumsily sprained my ankle whilst coming home from the station.. I had plannned to go to Bowral to see school friends but that came to an end. Tonight is Allys Bday party, i didn't know what to get her (the girls all went in and got her something already, didn't even ask me) so I just got her this hand cream set with little gloves. I think its so cute but i don't know, if she doesn't like it i guess I'll give her the receipt so she can change it... i am over caring what anyone thinks, if they are getting a present from me, they'd better just like it.   I think i'm good at presents, unlike some ppl (one yr the girls went in and got me a picnic basket - i already had one so now i have two cause i didn't want to rude and say anything)......and last yr i asked for cds and a toiletry bag for my upcoming trip and i got this white make up boxy thing which isn't really what i meant (and now lives underneath my bathroom sink in the cupboard as a general stoage thing), so i am going to have to be specific this year indeed...   Sigh.. Dave's bday is coming up and I have no idea what to get him. He is so hard to buy for! Particularly cause I think i am running out of ideas... He needs alot of things for his apt, like towels and a broom but i think getting those might be boring.  Hahah speaking of boring I asked him if he wanted concert tickets to the John Butler Trio and he said he'd like towels... so I guess towels it is then.. and I might take him for a nice meal... he loves king st wharf, as I do, his work always has these social club (yes he's in the social club) dos and the last one he raved on and on about!!! But i'm glad that he's enjoying his work!  Well, better go do some Uni work.. thats right I still have uni work...   BYE!!                 "

I have wanted to meet him for awhile but the opp never came up. I wondered about him for awhile now.. Eddy and I were at the Unibar and i saw him and his friend sitting there and waved, then went inside. After about 2 hours, they came over to us to talk and had a drink with us.  I thought he was from Shanghai but he is from Harbin, even further north, near Russia. Thats so cool, I have never met someone from there. He sais it is very cold.. His name is Jian Du. There was also another person I met today, a guy also , and he is from Penang!! His name is Sze Yen. Small world!!

4291530,female,23,indUnk,Virgo,"24,August,2004","   Hey everyone,  This weekend we were very busy! And we've had a lot of help from our friends. Our neighbors, William and Marie, are very sweet to us and we're always doing something with them throughout the week. William works for a towing company and Marie is a stay at home wife. They live with William's mom, Ida, who is currently having chemo for her breast cancer. She's doing okay, and we've been to see her a few times at the hospital when she stays there. In any case, William and Jeff love to play Diablo 2 together and are constantly talking about the game. William came over on Friday afternoon and told Jeff he needed to move our car. Jeff was a little confused and William said we needed to move our car next to his tow truck so he can fix our flat tire. Yes, our tire was flat! We knew that we had a screw in the tire, but we hadn't gotten around to fixing it yet. Turns out there was a slow leak and so our tire was slowly loosing air. So William popped out the screw, used his tire repair kit and we were all set to go. And William told us normally he'd charge 45 dollars for his services but for us, all he wants is Jeff to deck out his necromancer on Diablo 2. Which Jeff does happily!  Saturday Jeff and I wanted to put up our new chandelier in our stairwell. We've had this chandelier in a box in our living room for about 2 months waiting to get a ladder to hang it up with. Our old one was, well, old. One socket was broken and it was missing all of the glass cups around the light bulbs. The house was built in the 70's and I think that was the original chandelier. Needless to say, we needed a new one. So we got it and it sat in it's box forever. We asked around and my boss at work, Tammy, had a ladder. We just needed to go pick it up to use. Much better than buying one or renting one! So we decided to go down to Tammy's house and pick it up. We took Cinder with us because Tammy had been wanting to meet the puppy. She has a puppy too so we've been swapping stories at work.  We got to her house, and her puppy did not like Cinder, but Cinder was fascinated with Coco. Coco is a Chihuahua and Cinder is bigger than Coco and all Cinder wanted to do was play. But Coco would have none of that. We laughed a lot at them while we were cleaning off the ladder.  And then we tried to get the ladder into our car. We opened all the doors, the windows, put the seats down, everything. No such luck. We thought about tying it to the top of the car but that's a little dangerous. Tammy graciously offered to let us use her van for the day. So we loaded the ladder up, and drove back home.  Jeff got the chandelier up in about 2 hours. It looks fantastic. It's sort of a rustic look, blackened copper and clean lines, no flashiness. It has brightened up the stairwell a ton. In light and in style. It makes the house seem that much more put together. It's amazing what a nice light will do in the house!  After we dropped Tammy's car back off for her (no Cinder this time), we went to Tyson's Corner, a fantastic mall in our area, and bought Jeff new Sunday shoes. His old ones had split off from their soles and you could see his socks through the toes. So new shoes were needed! We found some nice ones at a shoe store in the mall. We also got some things that I needed for Primary on Sunday.  We also went to Target to get another light for our extra bedroom so when people come to stay, they have light in their room! We also got a few bathroom fixtures like a towel rack and a toilet paper roll. A very productive trip. :) We had dinner in a Mexican cafe right near there, and walked around the lake in the shopping area.  When we got home, Jeff put together the lamp and hung the bathroom fixtures while I played with the puppy. All in all, a busy and productive Saturday.  On Sunday, it was my Sunbeams' turn to teach sharing time, which means it was MY turn to teach sharing time. I was really nervous about it. Our theme for the month was 'How can I strengthen myself and my home through faith, repentance, and prayer?' So, I looked at the sharing time helps on  urlLink http://www.lds.org  and came up with one using the shield of faith and darts. See D&C 27: 15, 17. Jeff and I made 'fiery' darts from pipe cleaners and I taped them under a few chairs in primary. For every dart, I had something that could harm the faith in our houses or ourselves like 'You've just come home from church and your friend wants you to go to the movies with him. What should you do?' or 'You're really hungry and your mom is busy doing laundry. You want to eat lunch as soon as you can. What should you do?' That one got a lot of interesting responses. Ranging from 'make something yourself' to 'don't be so hungry!' In any case, Jeff made a shield out of a poster board and we wrote faith on it and had the kids who didn't have darts, come and hold the shield and respond to the problems. It was very cute and they had some really good answers. It went really well and I was pleased about that.  My Sunbeam class is growing in leaps and bounds! I started off with just 2 girls, and I now have 4 little girls (Shelby, 4, Kennan, 4, Katy, 3 and Hannah, 3) and a boy who is visiting for about a month (Zach, 4). They keep me on my toes. Their lesson this week was on I am thankful for my home. I was talking about a picture of a blossoming tree and they all piped up that it was the popcorn-popping tree! So we sang the song, and they proceeded to talk about what type of popcorn they had at their house. It was funny, but WAY off the topic. We got back to talking about who lives in trees and went from there. One thing that I introduced a few weeks ago as part of the lesson is selling Joseph into Egypt as a game. They each took turns being Joseph and everyone who was left were his brothers. I was the pharaoh, and the 'brothers' sold 'Joseph' to me and then came to ask for food. It was a very cute game and we have played it every Sunday for a month. Who knew it would be so popular.  We were able to play Diablo 2 with my dad as we do every Sunday. I think Dad and I died about 10 times. Good thing we're not hardcore players or we'd loose everything every time we died. We really look forward to playing every Sunday with Dad. :)  Sunday night we watched some of the Olympics that we had taped earlier. I've been following the swimming, and of course, the horses. We watched the stadium jumping finals and Germany won. USA came in 4th by like .2 points. I just enjoyed watching all the beautiful horses!  That's all for now! Check back frequently for updates! :) Love ya all, Catherine and Jeff   "
4291530,female,23,indUnk,Virgo,"20,August,2004","   Hello all,  This is the first post on my blog I made to keep everyone in touch with what Jeff and I are doing out here in Maryland. I know we don't keep in touch as much as we'd like to, and I thought that this would be a good thing to let everyone know what's been going on with us. So, just a quick overview and then I'll get up to date.  Jeff and I moved out to the east coast almost exactly a year ago. Although at the time we moved to Virginia to a nice apartment complex called Windsor at Potomac Vista in Woodbridge. It was a cute, 2 bedroom apartment on the second floor with a washer and dryer! My favorite thing in that apartment. We stayed there about 8 months and then moved to Maryland.  Why did we move? Well, in those 8 months that we lived there, Jeff got a job as a systems engineer at Lockheed Martin ( urlLink http://www.lockheedmartin.com ). The job was in Gaithersburg, MD and we thought it wouldn't be too bad of a commute for Jeff so that we could stay where we were. Boy were we wrong! He had a 2 and half hour commute one way, so that was 5 hours a day he spent trying to go places. We thought, 5 hours driving, 40 hour work week, and him going to school full time was too much. So we moved.  We decided to buy a house because the interest rates were fantastic and we would be paying just as much with rent as a mortgage payment. So we took the plunge! We used Weirchrt Relators and found the house we bought the very first day out looking. It was just what we were looking for. 3 bedrooms, 2 and a half baths, with another washer and dryer. Very important, those washer and dryers. :) So on April 1, 2004, we closed on the house and moved in! Jeff now only drives 10 minutes to work every day and is able to go home for lunch every day. Lucky dog.  So that pretty much brings us up to speed on where we are. Now on to what we're doing. We bought a Cairn Terrier puppy soon after moving to our house. We named her Dogwood Cinderella, Cinder for short. She was so sweet as a tiny puppy, and now she's just so much fun. She loves people and can do all sorts of tricks. She can sit, stay, lay down, speak, and shake. The shake is adorable but she sits and lays down the best.  We just celebrated our 3rd anniversary with a trip to West Virginia. It was beautiful. This summer has been nice and restful.  Coming up in our lives is school for Jeff. He'll continue at George Washington University as a grad student. This will be his last full year. I continue to work at Genetics and IVF ( urlLink http://www.givf.com ) in Fairfax, Virigina, making apointments for either infertility and prenatal genetic testing. Boy have I leared a lot!  We've been enjoying our time here in Maryland! More updates to come!  "
4313749,female,25,indUnk,Taurus,"24,August,2004","            Mornin, y'all.      Interesting bits in the news this morning. First off, over 750 fell sick while visiting South Bass Island in Lake Erie this summer. They're not sure what to blame it on... hm... could it be partly because the Great Lakes are some of the most polluted waters in the nation? You stick your hand in the cesspool, you ain't getting it back. It's almost as bad just to breathe in the sea spray. Or- it could be a dirty restaurant worker who failed to wash their hands after a potty break... You see why I don't like to eat at restaurants so much anymore? A pube in the food is enough to turn any stomach.      In other news, the porn industry may require their participants to wear protection. And it only took how many outbreaks of the clap and AIDs to spark this course of action?       Well, another interesting night in the Olympic arena. A white man can  run , and fast. Hats off to Jeremy Wariner for disproving all sports analysts and 99% of spectators who thought a white athlete would never beat a sprinter of any other color.       And- would you believe it- a  raucous  night in gymnastics?       It seems that the crowds have gotten tired of the scores that the judges are giving. After a practically perfect vault from Romania's Marian Dragulescu, the judges almost  begrudgingly  gave him a 9.9- I can't remember the last time I've seen a 10 in this sport.   No one in the world can vault like Dragulescu. No one can stick a landing after a front triple like Dragulescu. A 10 wasn't in the cards, but he's supposed to be happy with a 9.9?    At that point, he was sitting pretty ranked #1. After his score flashed, he hid the disappointment, but fell on his landing on a vault that should have been a walk in the park. You tell me that he wasn't affected by his score.    Move to the parallel bars- same story. A flawless performance by Hiroyuki Tomita was surpassed by a gymnast who was far less powerful and daring. On high bar, Alexei Nemov completed an unheard of six- count 'em, folks,  six-  release moves and stuck his landing. What was his score? 9.7 . It was enough to rile up the crowd and boo the judges. It lasted for ten minutes, postponing Paul Hamm's routine, until Nemov stood up and urged the crowd to stop. Hamm's performance was nearly void of any discrepancy, but in my opinion, not good enough to surpass Nemov, which he did. Unsurprisingly. Hamm won the silver, Nemov's score was enough to send him home in 5th place.    It was a Malaysian judge who didn't think Nemov was good enough for a medal. Didn't you all know? Malaysia is the world's leading producer of first-rate gymansts! Sure are- they keep 'em all in a box underground and they're planning a release in time for the 2012 games.     In other news... I haven't suffered a wedgie yet today.    Peace.                                     "

4313749,female,25,indUnk,Taurus,"22,August,2004","             Hello again, y'all.  I can't resist making a comment or two about Svetlana Khorkina, the russian prima donna of gymnastics.  It seems that Svetlana is pretty sore about losing the all-around competition to America's Carly Patterson last week, and has taken to vocalizing her opinions to a russian newspaper. See, she feels that the judges had predetermined Patterson as the winner, and in her words, 'fleeced' her for the entire competition.  Let me take a step back. Khorkina is a product of the russian sports machine. They've churned out numerous gymnasts, divers, volleyball players, and wrestlers, among others. In a country that is too poor to support its once to be reckoned with space program, they invest everything they can into their athletes, and it has been paying off- until recently.  Alexei Nemov is the last man to my knowledge to win the men's all-round in gymnastics for Russia. Alexander Popov was 'The Russian Rocket' in Barcelona, Atlanta, and Sydney, but resolved to slink out of the pool after failing to qualify for events in which he'd previously been so feared in Athens. Rulon Garder defeated the russian wrestling favorite (can't think of his name, but this man was a BEAR) to win the gold medal. Now, don't get me wrong- these are all awesome athletes. They once dominated thier respective sports, but knew enough when they were defeated. I can't think of anyone who has acted as unprofessoinal and unclassy as Khorkina.  In Sydney, it was discovered that the vault had been set five centimeters too low and consequently sent Khorkina crashing to her knees. My heart went out to her. She fell off the parallel bars. Again, my heart went out to her. In Athens, she fell off the bars again. Guess what? My heart went out to her. When Patterson defeated her in the all-around competition, I felt a sense of sadness as I knew that it would be Khorkina's last Olympics. She paraded around the appartus, toting her flag, draping it over the parallel bars, acting like she has for the past ten years or so- the russian darling slash prima donna- a very fitting role.  She commented that the silver medal was grand, in so many words, and that it was the best day of her life. Yet, four days later, she's changing her tune and crying foul. Give me a break! Khorkina should wait to talk smack after the Olympics are over and stop falling off apparatus- then maybe she'd win the gold medal.  Anyone watching the competition can clearly see that Patterson was the most mechanically correct out of the entire field. She didn't fall, she didn't stumble. She deserved the gold and got it.  Khorkina has to realize that even though she is a sentimental favorite in the sport, it's not going to earn her medals. Near-perfect routines sometimes aren't even enough. It's a different scenario than Paul Hamm and the korean controversy- there, it was the judges screw-up. Here, it is Khorkina's screw up. Get over it, Svetlana. You're not the top dog anymore. The top dog won the gold, and even if she doesn't travel to Beijing to defend her title, she is still the Olympic champion.  However, feel free to come up with your own opinion.      If you're going to award gold medals to sentimental favorites because you feel they should get it, call Popov back to the pool and give him a couple. Give Jenny Thompson three. Hell, I have a lot of friends- give ME one.  Oh, wait- that's not how you're supposed to do it? Somebody had better tell Khorkina.        Peace.           "
4313749,female,25,indUnk,Taurus,"22,August,2004","            Mornin', Y'all.      Six a.m. and I am tired.  Just woke up a half hour ago and I'm ready to crawl back under the covers and snuggle with my pillows.  Anyone else feel the drudgery of life like a vicious, neverending cycle?  Eat, sleep, poop, something like that?        I'm too old at 25 to live on the edge anymore, and on the edge I mean spending all my money at clubs and staying out til dawn, only to stumble into work still smelling like smoke and alcohol.  I did that for a while.  Some of my friends still do that.  Number one, I don't know where they get the money because we all make the same amount, and number two,  it should be old to them by now.    It's like those 35 year olds who still try to pick up girls at the club, all spiffy in thier silk shirts and tapered pants.  Just  old .      I start a new job with FedEx soon, and I'll be working creature of the night hours- seriously.  11 p.m. to 7 a.m. Sunday through Thursday.  Hey, I'm not complaining.  It means that I'll miss all the lovely traffic down the 101 every evil morning and all the little shits coming back from nights of crazy partying.  I am no so much concerned with hours as I am with making enough money to feed my belly and Jess'.  And maybe get that guitar I've been eyeing on Musicians Friend for a while- a Squier Strat, all black and shiny.  But that's not important.      Wonder what shift I'll work when I become a doctor.  I watched a show where this ER surgeon had worked mids for three years.  Now that's just too much.  I'm hoping that if I specialize, I can  sort of  make my own hours.   Someone tell me I'm dreaming- I don't know how this stuff works!      Anyway, anyway, anyway... Off to the place where I stare at a computer all day.  Hope this finds y'all well and behaving yourself.      Peace.                 "

4313749,female,25,indUnk,Taurus,"22,August,2004","            Ah yes, the summer Olympics are now halfway over. I've settled into the familiar routine of watching absolutely nothing but sports for days on end until three in the morning. In about a week, I'll be at a loss as of what to watch for a while and then I'll settle into another routine- the same one that I had  before  the Olympics.      There's always stories that come out of the Olympics that inspire, anger, satiate even. Already I can think of three.      I enjoy Michael Phelps. Not only does he have bragging rights, he  refuses  to use them. He loves to be part of a team. He credits everyone around him for helping him succeed in a sport where it's all touch and go, literally. He's one of the most composed and humble athletes I have ever watched, and it's absolutely refreshing. He swims all year-round to give credit to everyone, himself last.       Paul Hamm is said to have won the gold medal in the men's gymnastics all-around on a judging error, and that the medal should have gone to a korean gymnast. First of all, shut up. Paul fell onto his ass during a vault, sunk all the way down to 12th place, and was able to pull it together enough to medal. The fact that he did  that  should be enough. It's always the fat assholes who like to judge our elite athletes behind a microphone as if it's easy to compete at world class competition level against the best of the best. Who the hell is Al Troutwig? Has he ever competed a day in his life in gymnastics?      And Jenny Thompson. I've followed her swimming career for as long as I can remember. Everyone makes such a huge song and dance about how she's the world's best teammate, helping her team members to the top of the podium, but has never won and individual gold medal. Do they  notice  how fast swimmers are at this level? How close the races are? They speak of a second as if it's an hour. Give me a break. Jenny has balls the size of Manhattan to swim competitively while she's immersed in medical school. She's also suffered heartbreak this year after losing her mother. Again, fat bastards behind a microphone make it so easy to judge and point out flaws rather than significance of strength and courage.      I'd like to start a pestering squad to urge Jenny to come back just one more time for Beijing. Then, her critics will have to shut up. How many of them can swim 50 meters in under 25 seconds? Assholes.      I love them all, all shapes and colors and religions. They are beautiful, talented, hard working, and they deserve every accolade we can give them. They also help to encourage me to work out pretty hard for two weeks out of every four years.      One more question- who is this chick who calls commentary during diving? I have literally seen ten competitors dive into the water, produce absolutely  no  splash, and this Elfie girl will say something like 'Oh, no, she was short of vertical...' , 'Nope, there were three drops of splash that landed on the forehead of the chinese judge...' Anyone give me some insight?      You gotta love sport.      Peace.                "
3827097,female,15,Arts,Pisces,"06,July,2004","        Current Music:  Could It Be Magic - Donna Summer  Feeling:  blah  Ok, I'm late. Yeah and posting here since diaries.suchisthis, it's server, is being a bitch. Vicky and I headed to Kristen's house in the Bronx for a bbq. She lived far out but it didn't matter b/c we spent the night and it was worth it. Vicky and I ate a lot of chicken and hot dogs. But we  killed  the donuts. It was great but very  fullfilling , lol. Then soon as the hours went by we all went outside. Kristen's neighbors were lighting up fireworks in the middle of the street. It was cool and pretty at first but then it started to swift it's position. It went in the air but then as it went down it looked like it was going to hit us. I screamed my ass off and ran around the corner. There were many coming one after another. I think they did that on purpose just to enjoy our screaming of being terrorized. Kristen was just having a blast laughing at us. She was just standing there like it was no tomorrow. Hmm...let her ass get burned, lol, I'll be down the block. Later that night we had a ritual. A burning ritual. Lol. Vicky and Kristen were burning everything from plastic cups to pop rocks. Haha. It was great. I think Kristen has a slight fetish for hot wax. She kept pouring it on her from the candles outside. I was like what is wrong with you?? Do you know how hot that is? She was like it really doesn't burn. It feels so good. You should try it. -Pours-. *Lets out ahh.* :-/. I really worry about her. Then I was feeling a little darish and told them to flash the air. They only showed thier bras. Pussies I said. They were like well u haven't done anything yet, let me see you do it. So I did. I flashed the air with my feminine parts formely known as breast. =D. Then after burning half of the cups and ruining the poor cement we headed inside for the night. I was the 1st to take a shower. Then as soon as I get out Kris and Vicky both come in the bathroom and go in the shower...together...with thier clothes on. I'm like what in the world. They're like Sharice come in with us. It's gonna be fun so I get in, only I'm already washed and half a little towel on me. It was getting soaked so you know what I said fuck it and took it off. I was completely naked. It was great. Then they started washing thier hair. Vicky washed Kristen's and I washed Vicky's. Ahh those are the hightlights of the night. I had fun. It was the best 4th of July I ever had...yet. I'm out. Peace.    You are the Moon card. Entering the Moon we enter the intuitive and psychic realms. This is the stuff dreams are made on. And like dreams the imagery we find here may inspire us or torment us. Understanding the moon requires looking within. Our own bodily rhythms are echoed in this luminary that circles the earth every month and reflects the sun in its progress. Listening to those rhythms may produce visions and lead you towards insight. The Moon is a force that has legends attached to it. It carries with it both romance and insanity. Moonlight reveals itself as an illusion and it is only those willing to work with the force of dreams that are able to withstand this reflective light.
